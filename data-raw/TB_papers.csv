JOUR,article,972,An estimation of the scope for BCG vaccination in preventing tuberculosis among those aged 15–19 years in England and Wales at the present time,1959-01-01,"The second report of the Medical Research Council trial of tuberculosis vaccines in adolescents (Medical Research Council, 1959) contained an estimate of the benefit to be expected from BCG vaccination. If all those tuberculin-negative on entry to the trial in 1950–52, at the age of 14 years, had been vaccinated with BCG, the reduction in the incidence of tuberculosis in the ensuing five years would have been 59 per cent.The present study, by taking into account the recent decrease in risk of exposure to tuberculous infection in England and Wales, provides similar estimates of the scope for BCG vaccination, which are more up to date and also applicable to the whole country.Of the tuberculosis notifications among those aged 15–19 years in England and Wales in 1958, it is estimated that 52 per cent could have been prevented by BCG vaccination at the age of 14 years of all who were then tuberculin-negative. This estimate for 1958 is compared with that for 1953, which was 60 per cent. There has thus been a moderate decline in the scope for BCG vaccination during these five years. If the trend in exposure to tuberculous infection continues, BCG vaccination of all tuberculin-negative children who are aged 14 years now (1959) would apparently reduce the incidence when they become 15–19 years of age by rather less than half.In terms of the numbers of cases preventable by BCG vaccination of children aged 14 years, the scope has declined very considerably, from about 2,950 notifications among those aged 15–19 years in 1953, to 1,400 in the same age group in 1958. We may in a few years reach a situation in this country in which mass vaccination of older school children prevents only small numbers of cases of tuberculosis in adolescents. If, however, the protection from vaccination is maintained, cases will also be prevented in those aged 20 years and over.It is estimated that the official scheme for BCG vaccination at the age of 13 years, which started at the end of 1953, reduced the numbers of notifications at ages 15–19 years in England and Wales by 50 in 1956, 156 in 1957 and 241 in 1958. These small numbers are due to incomplete coverage of the 15–19 year age group in these years and the slow development of the scheme.It is suggested that a central bureau should be established to collect and interpret the information in connexion with the official vaccination scheme. This could make a valuable contribution to the eradication of tuberculosis from this country.

A descriptive mathematical model describing the flows between the various categories can be used to predict the trends both with and without intervention. An optimization model is derived from the descriptive model under the assumption that a program of reproduction of active cases has been specified.

JOUR,article,1008,The use of an epidemiological model for estimating the effectiveness of tuberculosis control measures. Sensitivity of the effectiveness of tuberculosis control measures to the coverage of the population,1969-01-01,"Given an adequate definition of the disease problem in epidemiological terms, it is possible to measure the epidemiological effectiveness of control measures in terms of problem reduction. This is to be distinguished from the clinical efficacy of the same measures. The practical difficulty in assessing the epidemiological effectiveness of control measures experimentally can be overcome by the construction of simulation models and the use of computers, whereby the problem reduction associated with various control strategies can be estimated numerically.By varying the levels of certain parameters of the model systematically, the sensitivity of the effectiveness of control measures to the epidemiological, operational, clinical and social parameters of a situation can be assessed. A series of articles analysing this relationship is under preparation. This first article analyses the sensitivity of the effectiveness of BCG vaccination and of the chemotherapy of tuberculosis to changes in the coverage of the eligible population groups. A previously formulated postulate stating that the marginal effectiveness of these measures decreases as their coverage increases is validated by this first series of simulations. The significance of this finding for planning national tuberculosis control strategies is discussed, as well as possible bias in the method applied.",41,0042-9686 (Print),75-93,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5309169,Bull World Health Organ

JOUR,article,1009,Use of an epidemiological model for estimating the effectiveness of tuberculosis control measures. Sensitivity of the effectiveness of tuberculosis control measures to the social time preference,1970-01-01,"Different combinations of coverage levels of BCG vaccination and of case-finding and treatment may achieve the same problem reduction in epidemiological terms. But the same problem reduction, in man-years of tuberculosis, may be valued differently in social terms.A social-time-preference parameter, of the form 1/(1+r)(t), is relevant to this evaluation and the level of r is critical for policy decision. The present paper studies the sensitivity of the effectiveness of BCG vaccination and of case-finding and treatment to the level of r, and the epidemiological mechanism underlying such sensitivity. A high value of r can be visualized as corresponding to a close planning horizon, a lower value of r to a more distant one. At any level of epidemiological effectiveness, a planner with a high value of r would favour case-finding and treatment, and a planner with a low value of r would tend to emphasize BCG vaccination. This influence of the social-time-preference parameter on the planner's decision is found to depend on the discounting effect of the parameter on the one hand, and on the different age- and time-patterns of the preventive effect of the major control measures, on the other.",43,0042-9686 (Print),1-16,NA,Bull World Health Organ

To facilitate work in such countries, a simple epidemiological model was made to calculate annual trends in the prevalence and incidence of tuberculosis and its infection, in tuberculosis mortality, and in BCG coverage, using average parameter values not specific for age groups or birth year cohorts. To test its approximation capabilities and limits, the model was applied to epidemiological data from Japan, where sufficient information was available from repeated nation-wide sample surveys and national statistics. The approximation was found to be satisfactory within certain limits.

JOUR,article,932,A method for estimating the prevalence of tuberculosis infection,1975-01-01,"The prevalence of tuberculous infection in a population is generally estimated from calculating the proportion of tested individuals who react with at least 10 mm of induration to 5 TU of PPD-S tuberculin. Reactions due to infection with atypical mycobacteria, however, may cause the prevalence to be overestimated. This paper is concerned with an alternative method of estimating the prevalence of infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The method utilizes population distributions of reaction size by dividing study populations into two groups--individuals with and without known exposure to tuberculosis. The mathematical model developed here removes the effect of atypical infections and provides a truer picture of tuberculous infection. Data from a Navy recruit population demonstrate the use of the model with the result that among recruits with no known exposure to tuberculosis, the estimated prevalence is reduced by about one-half. Among recuits with known exposure to tuberculosis, there is essentially no difference between the two methods. Important advantages in using this method are that probabilities of true infection by induration size are generated, and that itis less sensitive to variations caused by differences in reading techniques and in tuberculin potencies. Furthermore, it is applicable to other diseases if the underlying assumptions are met.",101,0002-9262 (Print),311-22,http://aje.oxfordjournals.org.ez.lshtm.ac.uk/content/101/4/311.full.pdf,Am J Epidemiol

This type of problem is critical for areas where financial resources are limiting. Our analysis is centered on the value of diagnosis and treatment in tuberculous meningitis (Tbm) and, because of its importance to developing countries, our epidemiologic data were derived from India. When financial costs are ignored, the introduction of second line therapy (e.g., Rifampin) leads to more cures than does the introduction of even a perfect diagnostic test. However, diagnostic tests (e.g., the Bromide partition test or possibly radioassays) markedly improve case finding and to some extent increase cure rates. All affects vary markedly with the prevalence of tuberculous meningitis in the population under study. For example, net financial savings would occur were a perfect nuclear test available and conventional therapy used at a prevalence of Tbm of 30% whereas there would be a net loss if the prevalence rose to 80%. This study underscores the need for detailed studies on the radiobromide partition test and for the development of new diagnostic tests, perhaps a radioimmunoassay of either the acid fast bacillus or of an antibody to it.",5,0340-6997 (Print),271-6,NA,Eur J Nucl Med

A theoretical model for the development of clinical tuberculosis following infection, linking from data on the risk of tuberculous infection and the incidence of clinical tuberculosis in the Netherlands",1982-01-01,"Information on the risk of tuberculous infection in the Netherlands has been linked with information on the incidence of tuberculosis, in an attempt to estimate the risks of developing the disease following infection or reinfection. It was postulated that: (a) those with a recent primary infection had a characteristic risk of developing progressive primary tuberculosis; (b) those with a distant (i.e. not recent) primary infection and a recent reinfection had a characteristic risk of developing exogenous tuberculosis; and (c) those with a distant primary infection but no recent reinfection had a characteristic risk of developing endogenous tuberculosis. The information on the risk of tuberculous infection was used to estimate the size of the population in each of these infection classes for different age-groups and calendar years in the Netherlands. Using multiple regression to link these population figures with the information on tuberculosis incidence in the same age group and calendar year, it was possible to estimate the above risks of developing tuberculosis. For Netherlands males aged 15-69 years during the period 1951-70 the three risks of developing pulmonary tuberculosis were estimated to be: (a) 5.06 per cent annually (for 5 years) following primary infection; (b) 1.91 per cent annually (for 5 years) following reinfection; (c) 0.0253 per cent annually, after the first 5 years following primary infection, in the absence of reinfection. The corresponding (and significantly different) estimated annual risks of development of pulmonary tuberculosis for females were 5.85, 1.10 and 0.0020 per cent respectively. From these risks, it may be estimated that the degree of protection conferred by a distant primary infection, against pulmonary tuberculosis arising from a recent reinfection, was 63 per cent for males and 81 per cent for females. The estimated relative proportions of cases of progressive primary, exogenous and endogenous tuberculosis varied considerably with age and calendar year. Progressive primary tuberculosis was dominant at the younger ages, exogenous and endogenous tuberculosis at older ages. At these older ages, the great majority of cases in the Netherlands in the early 1950s appeared to be exogenous in origin, but by 1970, with the decrease in the risk of infection, the exogenous contribution had dwindled substantially, especially among males.",63,0041-3879 (Print),255-68,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6763793,Tubercle and Lung Disease

JOUR,article,835,Mass screening models for contagious diseases with no latent period,1988-01-01,"In this paper, a simplified model describing the stochastic process underlying the etiology of contagious and noncontagious diseases with mass screening is developed. Typical examples might include screening of tuberculosis in urban ghetto areas, venereal diseases in the sexually active, or AIDS in high risk population groups. The model is addressed to diseases which have zero or negligible latent periods. In the model, it is assumed that the reliabilities of the screening tests are constant, and independent of how long the population unit has the disease. Both tests with perfect and imperfect reliabilities are considered. It is shown that most of the results of a 1978 study by W.P. Pierskalla and J.A. Voelker for noncontagious diseases can be generalized for contagious diseases. A mathematical program for computing the optimal test choice and screening periods is presented. It is shown that the optimal screening schedule is equally spaced for tests with perfect reliability.

JOUR,article,871,Social networks of disease spread in the lower Illinois valley: a simulation approach,1988-01-01,"This study illustrates the use of disease modeling and simulation techniques to the study of the spread of disease within and between social networks. A Reed-Frost type model of disease spread is used to construct a simulation of the spread of tuberculosis within three prehistoric populations of the Lower Illinois River Valley during Middle Woodland, Late Woodland, and Mississippian times. A high and low population size was modeled for each time period. Late Woodland model 2 (low population estimate) is the only model that experienced pathogen extinction with host survival. The rest of the models experienced rapid and severe host population decline. The results of the simulation suggest that a social network size of between 180 and 440 persons is required under the conditions of this model for host-pathogen coexistence (i.e., endemicity) to occur. The severe population decline experienced by these populations suggests that tuberculosis as modeled here could not have existed in these populations.

JOUR,article,930,Tuberculosis prevention: cost-effectiveness analysis of isoniazid chemoprophylaxis,1988-01-01,"Isoniazid chemoprophylaxis is not recommended for all persons infected with tubercle bacilli. Because of the small but significant risk of isoniazid hepatotoxicity, chemoprophylaxis is reserved for only those at the highest risk of tuberculosis activation. To evaluate this policy, we performed a cost-effectiveness analysis of isoniazid chemoprophylaxis for two populations with positive tuberculin skin tests: recent tuberculin converters, who are at high risk for activation, and older tuberculin reactors, who have a low risk for activation and for whom chemoprophylaxis is not now recommended. The cost-effectiveness ratios found were stable, despite wide variations in model assumptions and probability estimates. For high-risk tuberculin reactors, chemoprophylaxis resulted in net medical care monetary savings, extended life expectancy, and fewer fatal illnesses. For low-risk tuberculin reactors, chemoprophylaxis resulted in positive, but small, health effects. Because the cost to gain these positive effects were also small, the resulting cost-effectiveness ratios were reasonable and in the realm of accepted prevention strategies: $12,625 to gain one year of life and $35,011 to avert one death. These findings suggest that the current policy is too restrictive and that many in the large population of low-risk tuberculin reactors should be considered for isoniazid chemoprophylaxis.",4,0749-3797 (Print) 0749-3797 (Linking),102-9,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&dopt=Citation&list_uids=3134928,Am J Prev Med

Its effect in populations with a high proportion of dually infected individuals is likely to be significant. Sub-Saharan Africa is one such region and to better document the effect of HIV infection on tuberculosis there we developed a mathematical model to predict the likely extra numbers of tuberculosis cases due to it. A mathematical model was developed using a variety of scenarios giving a range of risks for the period 1980-2000. The four scenarios included (1) a low rate of 1% risk of tuberculosis infection in year 0 (1980) with 45% tuberculosis infection prevalence, and an HIV prevalence of 2% in 1989; (2) a 2% risk of tuberculosis infection in year 0 with 60% tuberculosis infection prevalence, and a 2% HIV prevalence in 1989; (3) a 2% risk of tuberculosis infection in year 0 with 60% tuberculosis infection prevalence, and a 10% HIV prevalence in 1989; and (4) a 2% risk of tuberculosis infection in year 0 with 60% tuberculosis infection prevalence and a 20% HIV prevalence in 1989. Under scenarios 1 and 2, a 50-60% increase in smear-positive rates in the subpopulation (15-45 years old) is predicted for the year 2000, under scenario 3, smear-positive rates in the subpopulation in the year 2000 are expected to increase four-fold from the 1980 baseline.

JOUR,article,572,Modelling the efficacy of prophylactic and curative therapies for preventing the spread of tuberculosis in Africa,1993-01-01,"Concerns have been raised about whether the interaction between tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) may lead worldwide to a recrudescent tuberculosis pandemic. These concerns are particularly grave in Africa which has a high prevalence of both tuberculosis and HIV. This study used a computer simulation model to examine the effect of tuberculosis-HIV interactions on tuberculosis prevalence and mortality in Africa. The model then assessed the impact of expanding treatment and chemoprophylaxis programmes on tuberculosis prevalence and mortality over the next decade. In communities where 20% of the population is infected with HIV and 25% receive treatment for tuberculosis, deaths from tuberculosis would be 100% higher than in communities where none of the population is HIV-infected. In a population the size of Uganda's, during one decade there would be approximately an additional 530,000 deaths from tuberculosis. When 50% of patients with active tuberculosis receive treatment, one death will be averted for every 2.5 people who receive treatment. The prevalence of active tuberculosis could be cut by over 90% in a decade by providing effective chemoprophylaxis to 30% of individuals with inactive TB. In conclusion, TB is only one example of a preventable and treatable infectious disease which can be spread through casual contact and which, because of its higher prevalence among the HIV positive population, may lead to a preventable increase in incidence of infection among the general population.",87,0035-9203 (Print),406-11,http://ac.els-cdn.com/003592039390014H/1-s2.0-003592039390014H-main.pdf?_tid=8ad90a4371d1c405a8a164c4f5f14d1d&acdnat=1345012470_496d33934a357930490bdffc26f770dd,Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg

Based on the expected number of infectious doses inhaled, the Poisson probability model traditionally is used to predict an individual's risk of infection.

At a 50% prevalence of tuberculosis infection among those at high background risk, and 5-10% among those at low risk, there would have been 34,000 cases of active tuberculosis in the cohort and their contacts if no prophylactic therapy had been used.

Such a policy would have prevented 21,800 cases of active tuberculosis. The estimated total discounted cost of a chemoprophylaxis programme would have been R51.3 million. In the absence of preventive therapy the discounted cost of treating patients with active tuberculosis would have been R91.9 million over the 8-year period. Therefore, if the benefits of chemoprophylaxis were defined in terms of averted health care costs, such a policy would have resulted in net savings of R40.6 million.

OBJECTIVES: To review the operating characteristics of the tuberculin skin test, to ascertain the validity of estimating prevalence and risk of infection from tuberculin skin test surveys under various conditions, and to review constraints in the estimation of the magnitude of the tuberculosis problem in the community from such surveys. METHODS: This report utilizes hypothetical and selected real data obtained in regional and national surveys at various points in time to exemplify methodological issues. RESULTS: Risk of infection, the essence to be abstracted from tuberculin skin test surveys, theoretically allows for a comparison of the extent of transmission of tubercle bacilli in various populations. However, the conduct of tuberculin skin test surveys and the analysis and interpretation of their results are not free from important technical problems. Accurate estimation of infection prevalence is particularly vulnerable to the great variability of the test's specificity under various circumstances. Furthermore, the annual risk of infection has averaging characteristics that preclude a rapid assessment of changes in transmission patterns. Finally, estimates of infection risk do not necessarily provide a standardized parameter to derive incidence of infectious cases, because of variations in the quality of intervention and varying risks of progression from latent infection to overt tuberculosis. CONCLUSIONS: While tuberculin skin test surveys provide the currently most widely used means of assessing tuberculosis transmission patterns over prolonged periods of time in a community, results from such surveys must be interpreted with caution when accurate estimates of the tuberculosis problem are sought.",76,0962-8479 (Print),114-121,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&dopt=Citation&list_uids=7780092,Tubercle and Lung Disease

In particular, we investigate the mechanisms by which bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium leprae persist at low densities for extended periods, and attain high densities much later. We suggest that the persistence of bacteria in face of immune pressure may result from the bacteria having a very slow growth rate, or having a dormant stage. We show that whereas these mechanisms may lead to long-term persistence, this will be obtained at relatively low densities. We then suggest that the long-term persistence of bacteria may result in the loss of immunity because of the deletion of specific T-cells arriving from the thymus, and the exhaustion of the specific T-cells as these cells reach the Hayflick limit and die. This loss of immunity will allow the bacteria to attain a high density.

The distribution of SN describes uncertainty in the future incidence value. Given variability in dose (and risk) among population members, the distribution of incidence is Poisson-binomial. However, depending on the value of E[SN], the distribution of incidence is adequately approximated by a Poisson distribution with parameter mu = E[SN], or by a normal distribution with mean and variance equal to E[SN] and Var[SN]. The general analytical framework is applied to occupational infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb). Tuberculosis is transmitted by inhalation of 1-5 microns particles carrying viable M. tb bacilli. Infection risk has traditionally been modeled by the expression: R(D) = 1 - exp(-D), where D is the expected number of bacilli that deposit in the pulmonary region. This model assumes that the infectious dose is one bacillus.

RESULTS: The direct costs of initial therapy with DOT and SAT were similar ($1,206 vs $1,221 per patient, respectively), although DOT was more expensive when patient time costs were included. When the costs of relapse and failure were included in the model, DOT was less expensive than SAT, whether considering outpatient costs only ($1,405 vs $2,314 per patient treated), outpatient plus inpatient costs ($2,785 vs $10,529 per patient treated), or outpatient, inpatient, and patients' time costs ($3,999 vs $12,167 per patient treated). Threshold analysis demonstrated that DOT was less expensive than SAT through a wide range of cost estimates and clinical event rates. CONCLUSION: Despite its greater initial cost, DOT is a more cost-effective strategy than SAT because it achieves a higher cure rate after initial therapy, and thereby decreases treatment costs associated with failure of therapy and acquired drug resistance. This cost-effectiveness analysis supports the widespread implementation of DOT.",112,0012-3692 (Print) 0012-3692 (Linking),63-70,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&dopt=Citation&list_uids=9228359,Chest

JOUR,article,570,Modelling the economic benefits of tuberculosis preventive therapy for people with HIV: the example of Zambia,1997-01-01,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the economic benefits and costs of providing isoniazid preventive therapy for tuberculosis (TB) in HIV-infected persons in Zambia. DESIGN: A spreadsheet model incorporating variables drawn from published studies and unpublished data. SUBJECTS: Data drawn from a number of different studies and published literature involving a range of subjects. SETTING: Zambia. RESULTS: Using data primarily from Zambia we have modelled the costs and benefits of a TB preventive therapy programme using daily isoniazid for 6 months. The basecase scenario assumes recruitment at a voluntary testing and counselling site where HIV seroprevalence is 30%; persons with HIV have a 25% probability of developing active TB during their lifetime; two additional cases of TB would be prevented per person completing a course of preventive therapy; compliance would be 63%, and the efficacy of the isoniazid in preventing active TB of 60%. The costs under this scenario would exceed the benefits by a factor of 1.16 [benefit: cost ratio (BCR) of 0.86]. However, if preventing one case of TB prevented an additional five cases, the benefits would exceed the costs by a significant margin (BCR of 1.71). Other scenarios indicate that the targeted preventive therapy of persons with HIV whose occupation or living situation places them in contact with a large number of others (teachers and students, health personnel, military and police, miners, prisoners, etc.) would yield significant net benefit. The operational challenge for TB preventive therapy is thus to identify and target large numbers of such persons.",11,0269-9370 (Print),919-25,http://graphics.tx.ovid.com/ovftpdfs/FPDDNCDCLFEDDD00/fs047/ovft/live/gv031/00002030/00002030-199707000-00012.pdf,AIDS

We examined the percentage of purified protein derivative conversions under various exposure conditions, environmental controlstrategies, and respiratory protective devices. We conclude that environmental control cannot eliminate the risk for TB transmission during high-risk procedures; respiratory protective devices, and particularly high-efficiency particulate air masks, may provide nearly complete protection if used with air filtration or ultraviolet irradiation. Nevertheless, the efficiency of these control measures decreases as the infectivity of the source case increases.

JOUR,article,775,Modelling the annual risk of tuberculosis infection,1997-01-01,"BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis has been declining in developed countries for a long time, as a result of the intrinsic epidemiological characteristics of this disease, combined with improvement in the standard of living and more recently the use of antibiotics. In these low prevalence countries, decisions concerning the objectives of tuberculosis programmes have to be taken and the consequences of short term changes in the sanitary situation have to be assessed. METHODS: A deterministic model, without age structure, of the dynamics of pulmonary tuberculosis is proposed. The model extends that of Waaler and is intended to be more suitable for application to developed countries. The flows between seven subgroups of population, based on the natural history of the disease, are modelled and vaccination is taken into account. Values of model parameters and initial prevalences were deduced from published data. RESULTS: As a first step, qualitative comparisons are performed between the model-predicted decline in the annual risk of infection (ARI) and data from the Netherlands tuberculosis survey. Using parameter values suited to France, our model shows that the predicted decline is slower in France than in the Netherlands; a result which tallies with epidemiological observations. Uses of the model as a decision tool are illustrated in two cases, that of ending systematic BCG vaccination and that of a sudden increase in the number of infectious cases.",26,0300-5771 (Print),190-203,http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/26/1/190.full.pdf,Int J Epidemiol

METHODS: Decision analysis was used to compare newer rapid and older nonrapid methods for diagnosing TB and testing for drug susceptibility. The average time to diagnosis, average time to treatment, average mortality, and cost of caring for patients evaluated for TB were compared. RESULTS: Using a combination of solid medium and broth cultures, nucleic acid probes for identification, and radiometric broth drug susceptibility testing would lead to diagnosis on average 15 days faster and to appropriate therapy on average five days sooner than methods currently employed by many U.S. laboratories. The average mortality would drop by five patients per 1000 patients evaluated (31%) and the average cost per patient would drop by $272 (18%). CONCLUSIONS: In this era of cost containment, it is important to incorporate test sensitivity and specificity when evaluating technologies. Tests with higher unit costs may lead to lower medical expenditures when diagnostic accuracy and speed are improved.

METHODS: The epidemiological consequences of cross-immunity were assessed by the formulation of a mathematical model of the transmission dynamics of tuberculosis and leprosy. RESULTS: The conditions under which Mycobacterium tuberculosis could have eradicated Mycobacterium leprae were derived in terms of the basic reproductive rates of the two infections and the degree of cross-immunity. CONCLUSIONS: If the degree of cross-immunity between two diseases within an individual is known, then the epidemiological consequences of this cross-immunity can be assessed with transmission modeling. The results of this analysis, in combination with previous estimates of the basic reproductive rate of tuberculosis and degree of cross-immunity, imply that tuberculosis could have contributed to the decline of leprosy if the basic reproductive rate of leprosy was low.",87,0090-0036 (Print),1923-7,NA,Am J Public Health

JOUR,article,893,The cost-effectiveness of preventing tuberculosis in physicians using tuberculin skin testing or a hypothetical vaccine,1997-01-01,"BACKGROUND: Tuberculin skin testing using the purified protein derivative is recommended as part of a tuberculosis control program for health care workers. However, compliance with skin testing programs has been poor and their cost-effectiveness is unknown. METHODS: A Markov-based decision analysis was performed to determine the cost-effectiveness of tuberculin skin testing over the entire lifetimes of physicians who are now in medical school. Assumptions were deliberately chosen to present a conservative estimate of cost-effectiveness. Indirect costs were not included. RESULTS: Annual testing cost $29,000 per life-year saved and $39,000 per case of pulmonary tuberculosis prevented. In contrast, particulate respirators have been shown to cost millions of dollars per case prevented. Skin testing every 6 months was cost-effective in a subpopulation at high risk of infection (> or = 1.8-fold). During their entire lifetimes, physicians now in medical school can expect to avert 137 cases of pulmonary tuberculosis, prevent 7 tuberculosis deaths, and save 182 life-years because of skin testing programs. Improved compliance with annual skin testing and prophylactic isoniazid could more than triple this benefit. If available, a moderately effective vaccine would be even more cost-effective than tuberculin skin testing programs. CONCLUSIONS: Tuberculin skin testing is cost-effective and should be an integral part of any tuberculosis control program.

JOUR,article,937,Monitored isoniazid prophylaxis for low-risk tuberculin reactors older than 35 years of age: a risk-benefit and cost-effectiveness analysis,1997-01-01,"BACKGROUND: Isoniazid chemoprophylaxis effectively prevents the development of active infectious tuberculosis. Current guidelines recommend withholding this prophylaxis for low-risk tuberculin reactors older than 35 years of age because of the risk for fatal isoniazid-induced hepatitis. However, recent studies have shown that monitoring for hepatotoxicity can significantly reduce the risk for isoniazid-related death. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of monitored isoniazid prophylaxis for low-risk tuberculin reactors older than 35 years of age. DESIGN: A Markov model was used to compare the health and economic outcomes of prescribing or withholding a course of prophylaxis for low-risk reactors 35, 50, or 70 years of age. Subsequent analyses evaluated costs and benefits when the effect of transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to contacts was included. MEASUREMENTS: Probability of survival at 1 year, number needed to treat, life expectancy, and cost per year of life gained for individual persons and total population. RESULTS: Isoniazid prophylaxis increased the probability of survival at 1 year and for all subsequent years. For 35-year old, 50-year-old, and 70-year-old tuberculin reactors, life expectancy increased by 4.9 days, 4.7 days, and 3.1 days, respectively, and costs per person decreased by $101, $69, and $11, respectively. When the effect of secondary transmission to contacts was included, the gains in life expectancy per person receiving prophylaxis were 10.0 days for 35-year-old reactors, 9.0 days for 50-year-old reactors, and 6.0 days for 70-year-old reactors. Costs per person for these cohorts decreased by $259, $203, and $100, respectively. The magnitude of the benefit of isoniazid prophylaxis is moderately sensitive to the effect of isoniazid on quality of life. The hypothetical provision of isoniazid prophylaxis for all low-risk reactors older than 35 years of age in the U.S. population could prevent 35,176 deaths and save $2.11 billion. CONCLUSIONS: Monitored isoniazid prophylaxis reduces mortality rates and health care costs for low-risk tuberculin reactors older than 35 years of age, although reductions for individual patients are small. For the U.S. population, however, the potential health benefits and economic savings resulting from wider use of monitored isoniazid prophylaxis are substantial.

JOUR,article,939,Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of the basic reproductive rate. Tuberculosis as an example,1997-01-01,"The basic reproductive rate (R0) is a measure of the severity of an epidemic. On the basis of replicated Latin hypercube sampling, the authors performed an uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of the basic reproductive rate of tuberculosis (TB). The uncertainty analysis allowed for the derivation of a frequency distribution for R0 and the assessment of the relative contribution each of the three components of R0 made when TB epidemics first arose centuries ago. (The three components of R0 are associated with fast, slow, and relapse TB.) R0 estimates indicated the existence of fairly severe epidemics when TB epidemics first arose. The R0 for the susceptible persons who developed TB slowly (R0(slow)) contributed the most to the R0 estimates; however, the relative R0(slow) contribution decreased as the severity of TB epidemics increased. The sensitivity of the magnitude of R0 to the uncertainty in estimating values of each of the input parameters was assessed. These results indicated that five of the nine input parameters, because of their estimation uncertainty, were influential in determining the magnitude of R0. This uncertainty and sensitivity methodology provides results that can aid investigators in understanding the historical epidemiology of TB by quantifying the effect of the transmission processes involved. Additionally, this method can be applied to the R0 of any other infectious disease to estimate the probability of an epidemic outbreak.",145,0002-9262 (Print),1127-37,http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/145/12/1127.full.pdf,Am J Epidemiol

JOUR,article,995,The annual risk of infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis in England and Wales since 1901,1997-01-01,"SETTING: England and Wales. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the magnitude and trend in the annual risk of infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis in England and Wales since 1901. DESIGN: Estimates for the prechemotherapy era are derived assuming that 1% of new infections among 0-4 year olds led to fatal tuberculosis meningitis, as found in the Netherlands. The estimates are validated against data from the 1949-1950 national tuberculin survey. We explore the trend thereafter using tuberculous meningitis notifications and data from the 1971-1973 national tuberculin survey, and discuss the utility of data collected under the national bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination scheme for estimating the annual risk of infection. RESULTS: Tuberculosis meningitis mortality rates among 0-4 year olds declined at 4% per annum until 1950, and suggest that the annual risk of infection declined from 12% in 1901 to 1.9% in 1949. The decline in the annual risk of infection probably accelerated in 1950, although its magnitude cannot be determined accurately. CONCLUSION: An accelerated decline in the annual risk of infection in England and Wales from 1950 probably resulted from the introduction of chemotherapy, which dramatically reduced the prevalence of sources of infection in the population. Data collected during the national BCG vaccination scheme were found to be unsuitable for estimating infection risks.",1,1027-3719 (Print),389-96,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9441091,International Journal of Tuberculosis and Lung Disease
JOUR,article,996,The natural history of tuberculosis: the implications of age-dependent risks of disease and the role of reinfection,1997-01-01,"Many aspects of the natural history of tuberculosis are poorly understood. Though it is recognized that clinical tuberculosis may follow shortly after initial infection ('primary' disease), or many years thereafter through either endogenous reactivation or after reinfection, the relative importance of these mechanisms is often disputed. The issue is complicated by the fact that the risks of developing disease are age-dependent, and reflect infection risks which may change over time. This paper estimates the age-dependent risks of developing tuberculosis using an age-structured deterministic model of the dynamics of tuberculous infection and disease in England and Wales since 1900. The work extends the classical studies of Sutherland and colleagues. The best estimates of the risks of developing 'primary' disease (within 5 years of initial infection) were approximately 4%, 9% and 14% for individuals infected at ages 0-10, 15 years and over 20 years respectively, and a previous infection appeared to impart little protection against (further) reinfection, but 16-41% protection against disease subsequent to reinfection for adolescents and adults. We also provide evidence that reinfection made an important contribution to tuberculous morbidity in the past, as (i) exclusion of exogenous disease from the model considerably worsened the fit to observed notification rates, and (ii) the dramatic decline in the risk of tuberculous infection from 1950 in England and Wales accelerated the decline in morbidity among all individuals, even among the older age groups with a high prevalence of tuberculous infection. We conclude that the risk of infection is the single most important factor affecting the magnitude of the tuberculous morbidity in a population, as it determines both the age pattern of initial infection (and hence the risk of developing disease) and the risk of reinfection.",119,NA,183-201.,"C:\users\rw\Papers\Vynnycky, Epi and Inf, 1997.pdf",Epidemiol Infect

An increase in TB cases was reported, however, in 1986, and an upward trend in TB incidence has continued. The turnaround in TB is well correlated with the rise of the HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) epidemic. The purpose of this work is to investigate, through the use of mathematical models, the magnitude and duration of the effect that the HIV epidemic may have on TB. Models are developed which reflect the transmission dynamics of both TB and HIV, and the relative merits of these models are discussed. The models are then linked together to form a model for the combined spread of both diseases. A numerical study is performed to investigate the influence of certain key parameters. The effect that HIV will have on the general population is found to be dependent on the contact structure between the general population and the HIV risk groups, as well as a possible shift in the dynamics associated with TB transmission.",143,0025-5564 (Print),35-60,NA,Math Biosci

JOUR,article,568,Prospects for worldwide tuberculosis control under the WHO DOTS strategy. Directly observed short-course therapy,1998-01-01,"BACKGROUND: WHO advocates the use of directly observed treatment with a short-course drug regimen as part of the DOTS strategy, but the potential effect of this strategy worldwide has not been investigated. METHODS: We developed an age-structured mathematical model to explore the characteristics of tuberculosis control under DOTS, and to forecast the effect of improved case finding and cure on tuberculosis epidemics for each of the six WHO regions. FINDINGS: In countries where the incidence of tuberculosis is stable and HIV-1 absent, a control programme that reaches the WHO targets of 70% case detection and 85% cure would reduce the incidence rate by 11% (range 8-12) per year and the death rate by 12% (9-13) per year. If tuberculosis has been in decline for some years, the same case detection and cure rates would have a smaller effect on incidence. DOTS saves a greater proportion of deaths than cases, and this difference is bigger in the presence of HIV-1. HIV-1 epidemics cause an increase in tuberculosis incidence, but do not substantially reduce the preventable proportion of cases and deaths. Without greater effort to control tuberculosis, the annual incidence of the disease is expected to increase by 41% (21-61) between 1998 and 2020 (from 7.4 million to 10.6 million cases per year). Achievement of WHO targets by 2010 would prevent 23% (15-30) or 48 million cases by 2020. INTERPRETATION: The potential effect of chemotherapy (delivered as DOTS) on tuberculosis is greater in many developing countries now than it was in developed countries 50 years ago. To exploit this potential, case detection and cure rates urgently need to be improved in the main endemic areas.",352,0140-6736 (Print),1886-91,http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0140673698031997/1-s2.0-S0140673698031997-main.pdf?_tid=28243448b090057ef68206195322d939&acdnat=1345104104_a8557f9be98cd1c666ed199d7693b80f,Lancet
JOUR,article,763,The relative efficacy of respirators and room ventilation in preventing occupational tuberculosis,1998-01-01,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the relative efficacy of personal respiratory protection as the concentrations of infectious aerosols increase or as room ventilation rates decrease. METHODS: We modified the Wells-Riley mathematical model of airborne transmission of disease by adding a variable for respirator leakage. We modeled three categories of infectiousness using various room ventilation rates and classes of respirators over a 10-hour exposure period. RESULTS: The risk of infection decreases exponentially with increasing room ventilation or with increasing personal respiratory protection. The relative efficacy of personal respiratory protection decreases as room ventilation rates increase or as the concentrations of infectious aerosols decrease. CONCLUSIONS: These modeling data suggest that the risk of occupational tuberculosis probably can be lowered considerably by using relatively simple respirators combined with modest room ventilation rates for the infectious aerosols likely to be present in isolation rooms of newly diagnosed patients. However, more sophisticated respirators may be needed to achieve a comparable risk reduction for exposures to more highly concentrated aerosols, such as may be generated during cough-inducing procedures or autopsies involving infectious patients. There is probably minimal benefit to the use of respirators in well-ventilated isolation rooms with patients receiving appropriate therapy.",19,0899-823X (Print),754-9,NA,Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol

This may explain the great variation (from below 0 to 80%) observed in protection by Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) against tuberculosis. This paper explores three models for the effect of such heterologous immunity, and demonstrates that: (a) if the immune responses to the microbial antigens in nature and in the vaccines differ qualitatively, there will be no effect on observed efficacy; (b) if the immune responses differ only quantitatively, the observed vaccine efficacy will be reduced, and it will be minimal when vaccine-induced and heterologous protection are of similar magnitude; and (c) if the heterologous exposure can block the vaccine action, then observed efficacy will be reduced and may even appear negative.

JOUR,article,845,Population dynamics of tuberculosis treatment: mathematical models of the roles of non-compliance and bacterial heterogeneity in the evolution of drug resistance,1998-01-01,"SETTING: Patient non-compliance and/or spatial heterogeneity in drug concentration or effectiveness may contribute to the emergence of drug resistance during multiple-drug chemotherapy of tuberculosis. OBJECTIVE: Using mathematical models of mycobacterial population dynamics under antimicrobial treatment, to assess the effects of non-compliance, heterogeneity and other factors on the success of treatment. DESIGN: A mathematical model is used to generate predictions about the ascent of drug resistance in treated hosts with non-compliance and/or a 'protected compartment' of bacteria where only one drug is active; simulations of a more realistic version of this model take into account random mutation, and different assumptions about the size of, and growth rate of bacteria in, the protected compartment. RESULTS: The existence of a protected compartment can increase the likelihood of resistance to the single drug active in that compartment, but only if bacteria resistant to that drug can grow in the protected compartment or if the host is non-adherent to the treatment regimen. However, the protected compartment may also slow the ascent of bacteria resistant to drugs not active in it (e.g. isoniazid) by providing a reservoir of non-selected mycobacteria. The model predicts that relative rates of killing are more important than mutation rates in determining the order in which resistant mutants ascend. Model predictions, in combination with data about drug resistance patterns, suggest that non-compliance, but not heterogeneity, is an important cause of treatment failure. CONCLUSION: Patterns of acquired drug resistance may be used to infer processes of selection during treatment; mathematical models can aid in generating predictions about the relative impacts of treatment parameters in the evolution of resistance, and eventually in suggesting improved treatment protocols.",2,1027-3719 (Print),187-99,NA,International Journal of Tuberculosis and Lung Disease

Calculated values (from the uncertainty analysis) for the disease incidence, disease prevalence, and mortality rates were approximately consistent with historical data. The time-dependent sensitivity analysis revealed that only a few of the model's input parameters significantly affected the severity of a tuberculosis epidemic; these parameters were the disease reactivation rate, the fraction of infected individuals who develop tuberculosis soon after infection, the number of individuals that an infectious individual infects per year, the disease death rate, and the population recruitment rate.

OBJECTIVE: To ascertain the cost-effectiveness of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the diagnosis of tuberculosis in an urban setting in a developing country. DESIGN: A cost-effectiveness analysis of PCR and direct smear microscopy examination based on theoretical modelling. The cost-effectiveness was expressed in costs per correctly diagnosed tuberculosis patient for each of the two diagnostic techniques. Data were obtained from the literature, from the staff and the register at the health facility and from structured interviews with patients. Assumptions were made when no data were available. RESULTS: The PCR is expected to be more specific and sensitive than the routine procedure for diagnosis, but it is also more costly. The routine procedure based on direct smear microscopy turned out to be 1.8 times as cost-effective as PCR. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that the PCR method can potentially be a cost-effective screening procedure for tuberculosis, provided that the largest contributing cost component, the costs of the PCR-kit, can be reduced substantially.",2,1027-3719 (Print),235-41,NA,International Journal of Tuberculosis and Lung Disease
JOUR,article,929,Short-course prophylaxis against tuberculosis in HIV-infected persons. A decision and cost-effectiveness analysis,1998-01-01,"BACKGROUND: Isoniazid prophylaxis for 12 months effectively prevents tuberculosis in HIV-infected persons and may decrease the incidence of other HIV-related disease and mortality. Recent clinical trials have found that some short-course regimens also effectively prevent tuberculosis. OBJECTIVE: To compare the benefits, risks, and cost-effectiveness of isoniazid prophylaxis and short-course prophylaxis regimens. DESIGN: Decision and cost-effectiveness analysis. SETTING: United States. PATIENTS: Hypothetical patients who are HIV-infected and have CD4 counts of 200 cells/mm3 or less and positive results on tuberculin skin tests. INTERVENTIONS: Isoniazid prophylaxis lasting 12 months and six short-course prophylaxis regimens of isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide alone or in combination. MEASUREMENTS: 5-year survival rate, life expectancy, lifetime incidence of tuberculosis, and cost per quality-adjusted life-year saved. RESULTS: Compared with no prophylaxis, the 12-month isoniazid regimen increased 5-year survival rates by 9% and life expectancy by 8.7 months, decreased incidence of tuberculosis by 27%, and saved 4 medical care dollars for every 1 spent on prophylaxis. Regimens of isoniazid for 6 months, isoniazid and rifampin for 3 months, and rifampin and pyrazinamide for 2 months had similar results: 6.2- to 8.6-month increases in life expectancy, 19% to 26% reductions in incidence of tuberculosis, and 1 to 7 medical care dollars saved for every 1 spent on prophylaxis. A 3-month regimen of isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide resulted in fewer clinical benefits and was the only regimen tested that did not save medical care dollars. CONCLUSIONS: Prophylaxis decreases the incidence of tuberculosis and increases life expectancy for HIV-infected patients. Some regimens save medical care dollars, and some short-course regimens have clinical and economic benefits similar to those of the 12-month isoniazid regimen. Short-course prophylaxis is a reasonable alternative to the 12-month isoniazid regimen.",129,0003-4819 (Print) 0003-4819 (Linking),779-86,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&dopt=Citation&list_uids=9841583,Ann Intern Med
JOUR,article,935,"Mathematical model for the epidemiology of tuberculosis, with estimates of the reproductive number and infection-delay function",1998-01-01,"The authors used epidemiologic data on tuberculosis to construct a model for the time delay from initial latent infection to active disease, when infection transmission occurs. They used case rate tables in the United States to calculate the fractional rate of change per annum (A) in the incidence of active tuberculosis. They then derived estimates for the effective reproductive number (R) and the cumulative transmission, defined as the number of people whom one infected person will infect in his or her lifetime and over many multiple successive transmissions, respectively. For A of -4 percent per year, the average US condition from 1930 to 1995, they estimate the reproductive number to be about 0.55 and the cumulative transmission to be about 1.2. The estimated rate of the new latent infections in the United States is 80,000 per year, the estimated prevalence of latent infections is 5 percent, and the number of transmissions of infection per active case is 3.5. From the model, the authors predicted active case rates in various age groups and compared them with published tables. The comparison suggests that the risk of activation decreases rapidly, then gradually, for the first 10 years after initial infection; the risk is relatively constant from 10 to 40 years and may decrease again after 40 years. The authors also discuss how this model can be used to help make decisions about tuberculosis control measures in the population.",147,0002-9262 (Print),398-406,http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/147/4/398.full.pdf,Am J Epidemiol

JOUR,article,997,The long-term dynamics of tuberculosis and other diseases with long serial intervals: implications of and for changing reproduction numbers,1998-01-01,"The net and basic reproduction numbers are among the most widely-applied concepts in infectious disease epidemiology. A net reproduction number (the average number of secondary infectious cases resulting from each case in a given population) of above 1 is conventionally associated with an increase in incidence; the basic reproduction number (defined analogously for a 'totally susceptible' population) provides a standard measure of the 'transmission potential' of an infection. Using a model of the epidemiology of tuberculosis in England and Wales since 1900, we demonstrate that these measures are difficult to apply if disease can follow reinfection, and that they lose their conventional interpretations if important epidemiological parameters, such as the rate of contact between individuals, change over the time interval between successive cases in a chain of transmission (the serial interval). The net reproduction number for tuberculosis in England and Wales appears to have been approximately 1 from 1900 until 1950, despite concurrent declines in morbidity and mortality rates, and it declined rapidly in the second half of this century. The basic reproduction number declined from about 3 in 1900, reached 2 by 1950, and first fell below 1 in about 1960. Reductions in effective contact between individuals over this period, measured in terms of the average number of individuals to whom each case could transmit the infection, meant that the conventional basic reproduction number measure (which does not consider subsequent changes in epidemiological parameters) for a given year failed to reflect the 'actual transmission potential' of the infection. This latter property is better described by a variant of the conventional measure which takes secular trends in contact into account. These results are relevant for the interpretation of trends in any infectious disease for which epidemiological parameters change over time periods comparable to the infectious period, incubation period or serial interval.",121,0950-2688 (Print),309-24,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9825782,Epidemiol Infect

It is never possible to include all cases of tuberculosis in a given population in a study, and the proportion of isolates found to be clustered will depend on the completeness of the sampling. Using stochastic simulation models based on real and hypothetical populations, the authors demonstrate the influence of incomplete sampling on the estimates of clustering obtained. The results show that as the sampling fraction increases, the proportion of isolates identified as clustered also increases and the variance of the estimated proportion clustered decreases. Cluster size is also important: the underestimation of clustering for any given sampling fraction is greater, and the variability in the results obtained is larger, for populations with small clusters than for those with the same number of individuals arranged in large clusters. A considerable amount of caution should be used in interpreting the results of studies on clustering of M. tuberculosis isolates, particularly when sampling fractions are small.",149,0002-9262 (Print),366-71,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10025480,Am J Epidemiol

There is evidence to believe the main factor for this resurgence has been the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Co-infection with HIV and M. Tuberculosis has profound implications for the course of both diseases. This study represents a first attempt to understand how the introduction of an opportunistic infection, namely Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacteria that causes TB, affects the dynamic interaction of HIV-1 and the immune system. We create a mathematical model using ordinary differential equations to describe the interaction of HIV and TB with the immune system. It is known that infection with TB can decrease the CD4(+) T cell counts-a key marker of AIDS progression; thus, it shortens survival in HIV infected individuals. Another main marker for HIV progression is the viral load. If this load is increased due to the presence of opportunistic infections, the disease progression is much more rapid.

JOUR,article,906,A cost-benefit analysis of BCG revaccination in the Czech Republic,1999-01-01,"We assessed the direct and indirect economic costs and benefits of the current policy of revaccinating tuberculin-negative schoolchildren in the Czech Republic. The analysis is conducted from the perspective of the payer for health care. In considering whether revaccination should be discontinued, we consistently made assumptions which tend to favor revaccination. The direct costs of revaccination are estimated at Czech Koruna (KCR) 15.0 million (US$0.46 million) annually. The direct benefits are the treatment costs saved for future cases averted by revaccination. These range from KCR 0.5 million (US$0.015 million, ambulatory care, excluding transmission benefits) to KCR 13.7 million (US$0.4 million, hospitalization, including transmission benefits). Costs exceed benefits even if children are revaccinated without prior tuberculin testing. The major indirect cost is the loss of work output attributable to tuberculosis morbidity. Counting the averted loss in output as a benefit does not change the results qualitatively, although there is a 50% chance that the benefits will be greater than costs if treatment continues to be hospital-based. Thus, the costs of revaccination in the Czech Republic are found to exceed benefits over most, plausible variations in parameter values.

The model predicted that DOT and self-administered therapy (SAT) cured 93.1 and 90.8% of these patients, respectively. DOT would initially cost $1.83 million more than SAT, but avert $569,191 in treatment cost for relapse cases and their contacts, for a net incremental cost of $1.27 million ($919 per patient treated), or $40,620 per additional case cured. The cost-effectiveness of DOT was sensitive to the default rate and relapse rate after completing SAT. DOT would generate cost savings only when the default and relapse rates were more than 32.2 and 9.2%, respectively.

JOUR,article,998,Interpreting the decline in tuberculosis: the role of secular trends in effective contact,1999-01-01,"BACKGROUND: The dramatic decline in tuberculosis (TB) in developed countries during the past century has been attributed to many factors, including improvements in living and social conditions and, more recently, effective treatment. Each of these changes should have reduced the average number of individuals 'effectively contacted' (i.e. sufficiently to transmit infection) by each infectious TB case. METHOD: Estimates of the average number of individuals effectively contacted by each infectious TB case, for each year since 1900 in England and Wales, are derived as the ratio between published estimates of the annual risk of infection and estimates of the prevalence of infectious cases, as derived using a published model of the epidemiology of TB. RESULTS: The results suggest that each infectious case contacted, on average, about 22 individuals in 1900 sufficiently to transmit Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, and that this number declined to about 10 by 1950 and to approximately one by 1990. CONCLUSIONS: Although several factors contributed to the decline in TB in developed countries during this century, a major contributor has been the decline in the number of effective contacts by each case over time. Similar declines have doubtless occurred over the past century for many infections in developed countries.",28,0300-5771 (Print),327-34,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10342699,Int J Epidemiol
JOUR,article,1025,"Directly observed therapy, short-course: the best way to prevent multidrug-resistant tuberculosis",1999-01-01,"Adherence to therapy in patients with tuberculosis (TB) is a major determinant of their outcomes. Unfortunately, there are no currently known predictors of adherence, given that this phenomenon represents a complex, task-specific behavior. Notwithstanding criticisms from civil liberty advocates, directly observed therapy (DOT), facilitated by education, holistic care, enablers and incentives, is still the best strategy to ensure patient adherence to treatment. To enhance delivery of DOT, short-course chemotherapy (SCC) must be strongly advocated. Monitoring of patient progress, dependable drug supply, and adequate programme funding are other important elements of the entire strategy. Indeed, since the global resurgence of TB and associated rampant drug resistance in the 1990s, directly observed therapy, short-course (DOTS) has now become the WHO strategy for effective TB control. Data obtained so far in different continents worldwide have underscored the unrivalled efficacy of DOTS in ensuring treatment success and preventing development of acquired drug resistance. The recent WHO/International Union against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (IUATLD) global project on anti-TB drug resistance surveillance has also revealed that countries in which >33-90% of the population has access to the WHO DOTS strategy have, as a group, lower levels of drug resistance: primary multidrug-resistant (MDR) (1.4%; median) and acquired MDR index (0. 6; median). The use of SCC was also inversely associated with the prevalence of combined resistance to any drug. Countries with MDR rates >2% reported using SCC in a median of 70% of their patients, compared with 100% in countries with MDR rates <2% (WHO/TB/97.229). Despite greater initial cost, DOTS is a more cost-effective strategy than self-administered therapy because it decreases the re-treatment costs associated with therapy failure and acquired drug resistance. Finally, in addition to harnessing the complementary roles of a national tuberculosis programme and community participation, DOTS might be further enhanced by the use of newly developed drugs with a long duration of action or more potent bactericidal and sterilizing activities.",45 Suppl 2,0009-3157 (Print),26-33,NA,Chemotherapy

JOUR,article,691,Modeling the epidemiology and economics of directly observed therapy in Baltimore,2000-01-01,"SETTING: From 1958 to 1978, Baltimore maintained one of the highest pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) rates in the US. But, from 1978 to 1992 its TB rate declined by 64.3% and its ranking for TB fell from second highest among large US cites to twenty-eighth. This TB trend coincided with the implementation of an aggressive directly observed therapy (DOT) program by Baltimore's Health Department. OBJECTIVES: We used modeling to estimate the range of TB cases prevented in Baltimore under DOT. Case estimates equal the difference between the observed number of TB cases in Baltimore versus the expected number if Baltimore's TB trend was replaced by the TB trend for the US (low estimate) or the TB trend for all US cities with over 250,000 residents (high estimate). Economic savings are estimated. RESULTS: Without DOT we estimate there would have been between 1,577 (53.6%) and 2,233 (75.9%) more TB cases in Baltimore, costing $18.8 million to $27.1 million. Cases prevented and expenditures saved increased with increased DOT participation. CONCLUSION: Our model predicts that Baltimore's TB decline accompanying DOT resulted in health care savings equal to twice the city's total TB control budget for this period. These results are most plausibly due to DOT, since it was the only major change in Baltimore's TB control program, and rising TB risk factors-AIDS, injection drug use, poverty-in a city where TB had been epidemic should have triggered a TB increase as in comparable US cities, rather than the observed decline. As national TB rates continue to decline it will be important to identify ways to capture and reinvest these savings to support effective TB control programs.",4,1027-3719 (Print),201-7,NA,International Journal of Tuberculosis and Lung Disease

We prospectively compared the yield and cost-effectiveness of two immigrant TB screening programs, using close-contact investigation and passive case detection. Study subjects included all immigration applicants undergoing radiographic screening, already arrived immigrants requiring surveillance for inactive TB, and close contacts of active cases resident in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, who were referred from June 1996 to June 1997 to the Montreal Chest Institute (MCI), a referral center specializing in respiratory diseases. For all subjects seen, demographic data, investigations, diagnoses, and therapy were abstracted from administrative data bases and medical charts. Estimated costs of detecting and treating each prevalent active case and preventing future active cases, based on federal and provincial health reimbursement schedules, were compared with the costs for passively diagnosed cases of active TB. Over a period of 1 yr, the three programs detected 27 cases of prevalent active TB and prevented 14 future cases. As compared with passive case detection, close-contact investigation resulted in net savings of $815 for each prevalent active case detected and treated and of $2,186 for each future active case prevented. The incremental cost to treat each case of prevalent active TB was $39,409 for applicant screening and $24,225 for surveillance, and the cost of preventing each case was $33,275 for applicants and $65,126 for surveillance.

The ""short-term reproductive number"" of tuberculosis is defined as the average number of tuberculosis cases developing within 1 year of infection. Multiplying the short-term reproductive number by the number of tuberculosis cases in each year and dividing by the subsequent year's tuberculosis case burden equals the proportion of tuberculosis cases in the subsequent year that are due to recent transmission. We carried out separate calculations for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative and HIV-positive tuberculosis cases. We applied the model to pulmonary (infectious) tuberculosis cases diagnosed in New York City during 1989-1993, using tuberculosis and AIDS surveillance data. Model-based estimates of the proportion of tuberculosis due to recent transmission were lower than estimates based on DNA fingerprints.

Standard short-course chemotherapy (SSCC) can rapidly control illness and dramatically reduce the chance of death, but the impact of treatment has rarely been evaluated in these terms. METHOD: We developed a mathematical model that makes use of routinely-collected data to calculate the number of deaths directly prevented by TB treatment (i.e. excluding those due to reduced transmission). The method was applied to the world's largest TB control programme covering over 500 million people in 12 provinces of China. RESULTS: Counties which had been enrolled in the programme since 1991 were, by 1997, preventing at least 46% (37-56%) of the TB deaths that would otherwise have occurred. If replicated across the entire TB control programme area, this would amount to 30 000 (range 26 000-59 000) deaths directly prevented each year.

TB kills two million people each year and foci of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) have been identified in Eastern Europe, Africa, Asia, and Latin America. A critical question for health policy is whether standardized short-course chemotherapy for TB, based on cheap first-line drugs, can prevent and reverse the spread of drug resistance. Here we use mathematical modeling, in conjunction with treatment results from six countries, to show that best-practice short-course chemotherapy is highly likely to bring strains resistant to either of the two key drugs isoniazid and rifampicin under control and to prevent the emergence of MDR-TB. However, it is not certain to contain MDR-TB once it has emerged, partly because cure rates are too low. We estimate that approximately 70% of prevalent, infectious MDR-TB cases should be detected and treated each year, and at least 80% of these cases should be cured, in order to prevent outbreaks of MDR-TB. Poor control programs should aim to increase case detection and cure rates together for three reasons: (i) these variables act synergistically; (ii) when either is low, the other cannot succeed alone; and (iii) the second-line drugs needed to raise MDR-TB cure rates are few and extremely costly.

JOUR,article,761,A model for tuberculosis with exogenous reinfection,2000-01-01,"Following primary tuberculosis (TB) infection, only approximately 10% of individuals develop active T.B. Most people are assumed to mount an effective immune response to the initial infection that limits proliferation of the bacilli and leads to long-lasting partial immunity both to further infection and to reactivation of latent bacilli remaining from the original infection. Infected individuals may develop active TB as a consequence of exogenous reinfection, i.e., acquiring a new infection from another infectious individual. Our results in this paper suggest that exogenous reinfection has a drastic effect on the qualitative dynamics of TB. The incorporation of exogenous reinfection into our TB model allows the possibility of a subcritical bifurcation at the critical value of the basic reproductive number R(0)=1, and hence the existence of multiple endemic equilibria for R(0)<1 and the exogenous reinfection rate larger than a threshold. Our results suggest that reducing R(0) to be smaller than one may not be sufficient to eradicate the disease. An additional reduction in reinfection rate may be required.

JOUR,article,802,Pediatric tuberculosis: what needs to be done to decrease morbidity and mortality,2000-01-01,"OBJECTIVE: Tuberculosis (TB) control programs have been less successful among children than among adults in the United States. Between 1992 and 1997, the rate of decline of TB cases among 0- to 14-year-old children was less than the rate of decline among any other age group of US-born persons. Because of the higher prevalence of active TB among adults and their higher infectivity, most programs for TB in the United States have targeted adults. The inherent assumption has been that by targeting adults, from whom children may become infected, TB morbidity and mortality among children also will be reduced effectively. METHODS: Using a semi-Markov model that divided the US population into age groups <15 years old and >/=15 years old and into 18 clinical states based on the risk for or presence of TB and human immunodeficiency virus infection, we developed a computer-based simulation model to examine the effect of a range of potential TB control strategies on projected TB cases and deaths in children. We compare the impact of interventions targeted at children with the impact of interventions targeted at adults on pediatric morbidity and mortality. RESULTS: After 10 years, a 5% increase in the number of adults with TB who enter treatment would only lead to a.05% decline in TB cases among children, compared with predicted cases without this intervention. Improving treatment efficacy among those adults who are already receiving treatment for their TB leads to a smaller decline in cases among children of only.003%. In contrast, a 5% increase in the number of children who enter treatment leads to a 25% decline, after 10 years, in the number of TB cases among children and a 16% decline in the number of TB deaths. In the presence of immigration of tuberculin-positive children, the benefit of targeting programs directly at children is magnified. CONCLUSIONS: Marginal changes in programs targeted directly at children are significantly more effective at further reducing pediatric TB morbidity and mortality than the same changes in programs targeted at adults with the indirect goal of reducing spread to children. Marginal increases in the number of children who enter treatment are far more effective at decreasing morbidity and mortality than equivalent marginal increases in treatment effectiveness. Unfortunately, declining insurance coverage and increasing restrictions on services to immigrants have made it harder for those who are at greatest risk of TB to get medical care. Marginal increases in preventive therapy rates substantially reduce future pediatric TB cases and deaths among children with TB infection and human immunodeficiency virus.",106,1098-4275 (Electronic),E1,http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/106/1/e1.full.pdf,Pediatrics

We compared the completion rates, number of adverse effects, and cost effectiveness of these two regimens. Patients were treated at the San Francisco Tuberculosis Clinic from 1993 through 1996. A Markov model was developed to assess impact on life expectancy and costs. One thousand twenty-two patients, with a mean age of 52 yr, and > 90% foreign born, were treated; 545 received isoniazid and 477 received isoniazid and rifampin. For isoniazid, 79.8% completed 12 mo of therapy and 4.9% had adverse effects versus 83.6% completion, 6.1% adverse effects for isoniazid and rifampin (p > 0.05 for all between-group comparisons). Both regimens increased life expectancy by 1.4-1.5 yr. Compared with isoniazid, isoniazid and rifampin produced net incremental savings of $135 per patient treated. In patients with radiographic evidence of prior tuberculosis who have not been previously treated, isoniazid for 12 mo and isoniazid and rifampin for 4 mo have similar rates of completion and adverse effects, and both increase life expectancy compared with no treatment. Isoniazid and rifampin for 4 mo is cost saving compared with isoniazid alone. This advantage was maintained even when compared with 9 mo of isoniazid, the new American Thoracic Society/Centers for Disease Control (ATS/CDC) recommendation for treatment with isoniazid alone.",162,1073-449X (Print),1648-52,http://ajrccm.atsjournals.org/content/162/5/1648.full.pdf,Am J Respir Crit Care Med

Our results show that even moderately effective vaccines could have a significant effect on reducing tuberculosis epidemics if they can be coupled with moderate to high treatment rates. We suggest that both preexposure and postexposure tuberculosis vaccines can be used to help eliminate tuberculosis in developing countries.

JOUR,article,841,The rapid diagnosis of smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis: a cost-effectiveness analysis,2000-01-01,"OBJECTIVE: The prompt diagnosis of smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) is a clinical challenge. It may be achieved by a number of tests which have varying accuracies, costs and degrees of invasiveness. The objective of this study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of clinical judgement (empirical), the Roche Cobas amplicor assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (amplicor), acid-fast staining of bronchoalveolar lavage specimens (BAL), nucleic acid amplification tests of bronchoalveloar lavage specimens for M. tuberculosis (BAL + NAA), computed tomography (CT) and amplicor assay followed by BAL. METHODOLOGY: The range of predictive values of the various strategies were derived from published data and a new study of 441 consecutive adult patients with suspected smear-negative PTB prospectively stratified into three pretest risk groups: low, intermediate and high. The cost-effectiveness was evaluated with a decision tree model (DATA software). RESULTS: The incidence of PTB was 5.7% (4% culture positive) for the whole group, 95% in the high-risk group, 0.9% in the low-risk group and 3.4% in the intermediate-risk group. The sensitivity of the empirical approach was 49% and of the amplicor assay was 44%. Patient outcomes were expressed as life expectancy for the base case of a 58-year-old man with a pretest probability of 5.7%. At this low pretest risk the differences in life expectancies between tests was < 0.1 years and the empirical approach incurred the lowest cost. Sensitivity analysis at increasing pretest risks showed better life expectancies (approximately 1 years) for CT scan and test combinations than empirical and amplicor for additional costs of US$243-US$309. Bronchoalveolar lavage had the worst overall cost-effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the pretest risk of active PTB was a key determinant of test utility; that the AMPLICOR assay was comparable to clinical judgement; that BAL was the least useful test; and that with increasing risks, CT scan and test combinations performed better. Further studies are needed to better define patients with intermediate risk for PTB and to directly compare the cost-effectiveness of more sensitive nucleic acid amplification tests such as the enhanced Gen Probe, CT scan and test combinations/sequences in these patients.",5,1323-7799 (Print) 1323-7799 (Linking),403-9,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&dopt=Citation&list_uids=11192555,Respirology
JOUR,article,849,Cost effectiveness analysis of school based Mantoux screening for TB infection,2000-01-01,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of adding school based Mantoux screening programs to the New South Wales current TB prevention strategy. METHOD: A decision analysis model compared the costs and consequences of screening strategies against the current no-screen strategy. Costs associated with screening and with treating future cases of TB were considered. Consequences considered were deaths and adult cases of TB prevented. The study was based on data from prevalence surveys conducted in 1992 and 1994 in Central and South Western Sydney, New South Wales. Screening strategies considered were screening all or only overseas born (OSB) 6 year olds and all or only OSB 14 year olds in school settings. RESULTS: Screening 14 year olds prevented more deaths and adult cases of TB than screening 6 year olds for a similar cost. For both age groups targeted screening of OSB children was more cost-effective than screening all children. Targeted screening of 14 year olds--the most cost effective option--cost $17,956 (costs and benefits discounted at 5%) per adult case prevented, equivalent to approximately $130,000 per life year saved. The cost-effectiveness ratios decline substantially if lower discount rates and less conservative assumptions are applied. CONCLUSION: Targeted screening was more cost effective than screening all children, however, there are ethical implications of targeting a group based on their origin of birth.

JOUR,article,851,The cost-effectiveness of evidence-based guidelines and practice for screening and prevention of tuberculosis,2000-01-01,"INTRODUCTION: The potential cost-effectiveness of screening depends on the risk of tuberculosis (TB) in the population being screened and the rate at which the screening outcome (prevention) is achieved. AIMS: To compare the cost-effectiveness of contact screening for TB for: (1) contact screening as it actually occurred in Victoria in 1991 (Model 1); (2) the process which should have occurred had the 1991 contact screening guidelines been followed (Model 2); (3) a hypothetical evidence-based model (Model 3). METHODS: Three models were constructed according to the aims. The cost-effectiveness of contact screening is presented as costs to government per unit outcome (in the form of cases prevented, cases found and contacts traced) for each model. Assumptions about disease behaviour were consistent between models. A sensitivity analysis was performed to examine the effect of the assumptions made in Model 3 about rates of referral and treatment of infected contacts, and about the efficacy of isoniazid (INH) in preventing TB. RESULTS: The total cost of Model 1 was greater than that of the other Models. Model 1 is the least cost-effective, costing $309 065 per case prevented, and Model 3 is the most cost-effective, costing $32 210 per case prevented. The cost of Model 2 was $58 742 per case prevented. The incremental cost-effectiveness of Model 3 compared to Model 2 is $107 per additional contact screened, and $3881 per additional case prevented. Case finding is not as cost-effective as best-practice case prevention, ranging from $231 799 per case found in Model 1 to $205 596 per case found in Model 2. The sensitivity analysis shows that the cost-effectiveness of Model 3 decreases with lower referral rates, lower rates of preventive therapy, and lower efficacy of INH. However, even allowing for reduced programme parameters, Model 3 is most cost-effective. DISCUSSION: Costing policy options is an important component of programme delivery, but needs to be considered in the context of the product being purchased, e.g. the prevention of disease, or case finding. Case finding as a product of contact screening is expensive in all three models. Prevention of TB, on the other hand, can be cost-effective, as shown in Model 3. It was least cost-effective in Model 1, largely because prevention was not considered a priority, and few infected contacts actually received preventive therapy. Clear programme aims, adherence to guidelines and high rates of preventive therapy are essential in order to achieve cost-effectiveness.",9,1057-9230 (Print) 1057-9230 (Linking),411-21,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&dopt=Citation&list_uids=10903541,Health Econ

JOUR,article,896,Markov modeling of contaminant concentrations in indoor air,2000-01-01,"Most models for contaminant dispersion in indoor air are deterministic and do not account for the probabilistic nature of the pollutant concentration at a given room position and time. Such variability can be important when estimating concentrations involving small numbers of contaminant particles. This article describes the use of probabilistic models termed Markov chains to account for a portion of this variability. The deterministic and Markov models are related in that the former provide the expected concentration values. To explain this relationship, a single-zone (well-mixed room) scenario is described as a Markov chain. Subsequently, a two-zone room is cast as a Markov model, and the latter is applied to assessing a health care worker's risk of tuberculosis infection. Airborne particles carrying Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli are usually present in small numbers in a room occupied by an infectious tuberculosis patient. For a given scenario, the Markov model permits estimates of variability in exposure intensity and the resulting variability in infection risk.",61,1529-8663 (Print),484-91,NA,Am Ind Hyg Assoc J 
JOUR,article,925,A statistical analysis of the seasonality in pulmonary tuberculosis,2000-01-01,"The present study examines whether pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) has an annual seasonal pattern. A mathematical model is also obtained to forecast the pattern of incidence. The data for the study are the cases of PTB reported throughout Spain, published in the Epidemiology Bulletin by the Carlos III Health Center of the Spanish Ministry of Health in a 26-year period, 1971-1996. The analytical results show that the low rates in tuberculosis notifications over the period 1971-1981 have changed, halting in 1982 and reversing with high incidence from 1983 onwards. An annual seasonal pattern was also shown with higher incidence during summer and autumn. With the mathematical model we predicted the disease behaviour in 1997 and the results were compared to the reported cases. In Spain, as in several industrialised countries, the reason for this recent increase in the number of reported cases is, mainly, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The seasonal trend, with higher incidence in winter, can be attributed to the increase in indoor activities, much more common than in a warm climate. The tubercle bacilli expelled from infected persons in a room with closed windows may remain infectious for a long time, increasing the risk of exposure of healthy persons to the bacilli. As the preclinical period, from exposure to clinical onset, may be of several weeks, the high incidence in spring would be explained. Moreover, in winter and spring the infections of viral aetiology, like flu, are more frequent and cause immunological deficiency which is another reason for the seasonal trend observed. An incidence greater than that foreseen by the mathematical model would express a failure in epidemiologic surveillance, and thus the results of this study may be used to assess a quality of the preventive measures.",16,0393-2990 (Print),483-8,NA,Eur J Epidemiol
JOUR,article,948,Tuberculosis screening of immigrants to low-prevalence countries. A cost-effectiveness analysis,2000-01-01,"All adult immigrant applicants to Canada undergo chest radiographic screening for tuberculosis (TB). Tuberculin skin testing could reduce the number of chest X-rays, and identify more candidates for prophylaxis. We modeled the cost-effectiveness of chest radiography and tuberculin skin testing for TB prevention over a 20-yr time frame, among three simulated cohorts of 20-yr-old immigrants. Compared with no screening, radiographic screening prevented 4.3% of expected active TB cases in the highest risk cohort (50% TB-infected, 10% human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] seroprevalence), and 8.0% in the lowest risk cohort (5% TB-infected, 1% HIV seroprevalence). Tuberculin skin testing further reduced the expected incidence 8.0% and 4.0%, respectively. Compared with no screening, radiographic screening cost $3,943 Canadian per active TB case prevented in the highest risk cohort, and $236,496 per case prevented in the lowest risk group. Compared with radiographic screening, mass tuberculin skin testing cost $32,601 per additional case prevented in the highest risk group, and $68,799 per additional case prevented in the lowest risk group. Chest radiographic screening of young immigrants from countries with a high prevalence of TB is a relatively inexpensive means of TB prevention. Tuberculin skin testing is considerably less cost-effective. For immigrants from low-prevalence countries, both interventions are extremely costly with negligible impact. The cost-effectiveness of either strategy would be greatly enhanced by increased adherence to chemoprophylaxis recommendations. Radiographic screening of groups with a high prevalence of tuberculous infection will then likely save money.",161,1073-449X (Print),780-9,NA,Am J Respir Crit Care Med
JOUR,article,981,The dynamics of repeated elements: applications to the epidemiology of tuberculosis,2000-01-01,"We propose a stepwise mutation model to describe the dynamics of DNA fingerprint variation in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The genome of M. tuberculosis carries insertion sequences (IS6110) that are relatively stable over time periods of months but have an observable transposition rate over longer time scales. Variability in copy number and genomic location of (IS6110) can be harnessed to generate a DNA fingerprint for each strain, by digesting the genome with a restriction enzyme and using a portion of the element as a probe for Southern blots. The number of bands found for a given genome approximates the number of copies of IS6110 it carries. A large data set of such fingerprints from tuberculosis (TB) cases in San Francisco provides an observed distribution of IS6110 copy number. Implementation of the model through deterministic and stochastic simulation indicates some general features of IS/TB dynamics. By comparing observations with outcomes of the model, we conclude that the IS/TB system is very heterogeneous and far from equilibrium.

JOUR,article,999,"Lifetime risks, incubation period, and serial interval of tuberculosis",2000-01-01,"The lifetime risk of developing disease, the incubation period, and the time period between infection and transmission (the serial interval) are three important measures for interpreting trends in tuberculous infection and disease but are complicated by strong age dependencies regarding disease risk and by the potential for reinfection to occur. By using a model of the epidemiology of tuberculosis in England and Wales, the authors demonstrated that all three measures changed dramatically during the 20th century largely as a result of declines in the risk of infection. The estimated lifetime risk was highest following infection in early adulthood and declined with year of infection; the age-weighted average was approximately 12% during the last 50 years. Incubation period distributions depend on whether they are viewed prospectively (from infection to disease onset) or retrospectively (since infection for cases with disease onset at a particular time). As children rarely develop infectious forms of tuberculosis, infections acquired in childhood are associated with considerably longer serial intervals than those acquired in adulthood. These unusual properties are probably shared by other infections with long intervals between infection and disease. The results are important for interpreting data on transmission patterns, as are now being derived from molecular epidemiologic studies.",152,0002-9262 (Print),247-63,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10933272,Am J Epidemiol
JOUR,article,662,Modeling the economic benefits of better TB vaccines,2001-01-01,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the economic benefits of a better tuberculosis (TB) vaccine by modeling prevented TB medical spending and lost productivity throughout the world. DESIGN: One model is based on benefits obtained from reducing the impact of TB on health spending. An alternative model is based on minimizing the impact of TB on health spending and lost productivity due to death and disability. Both models are applied to various world populations based on secondary data. RESULTS: In terms of avoided medical spending, preventing 100% of the TB risk in a single individual is estimated to be worth from $38 for males in formerly socialist countries to S0.23 for children in Asia. More than 1 billion people would reckon their expected medical savings to exceed $25.00 if they received a 75% effective vaccine of 10 years' duration. Preventing lost productivity is worth substantially more throughout the world.

DNA fingerprints of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates were matched to patient information in the Netherlands Tuberculosis Register for 1993-1998. Clusters were defined as groups of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis whose isolates had identical DNA fingerprints. Source cases were assigned by using two models. The first-case model assumed that the first diagnosed case was the source case. The incidence rate model estimated source case probabilities from the incidence rates of potential source cases and the time of diagnosis. DNA fingerprints of 6,102 isolates were matched to patient information on 5,080 (83%) cases, 3,479 of whom had pulmonary disease. According to both models, the number of infectious cases generated per source case was lower for female than for male source cases and decreased with increasing age of the source case.

JOUR,article,676,Strategies to decrease tuberculosis in us homeless populations: a computer simulation model,2001-01-01,"CONTEXT: The rate of tuberculosis (TB) among US homeless persons may be 20 times that of the general adult population. Studies suggest that the majority of urban homeless TB cases are attributable to ongoing transmission of TB. Optimal TB-control strategies in both chronically and transiently homeless populations are not known. OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of TB-control strategies on projected TB cases and deaths in US homeless populations using a computer-based simulation model. DESIGN, SETTING, AND POPULATION: The US general population and a theoretical population of 2 million homeless individuals in 1995 were divided into 18 clinical states based on the risk for or presence of TB and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in a semi-Markov model. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of transiently and chronically homeless individuals with active TB and deaths from TB as a function of public health measures taken to control and eliminate TB, including improvement of treatment effectiveness, improvement in access to treatment, and vaccination with BCG. RESULTS: A 10% increase in access to treatment among homeless persons with active TB produced larger declines in predicted TB cases and deaths after 10 years (cases and deaths among chronically homeless persons decreased 12.5% and 19.8% and among transiently homeless persons dropped 35.9% and 32.4%, respectively) than improvements in the effectiveness of treatment programs (cases and deaths among chronically homeless persons declined 7.2% and 3.1% and among transiently homeless persons dropped 10.9% and 4.1%, respectively). A 10% increase in access to treatment among homeless persons with latent TB infection led to a 6.7% decline in TB among chronically homeless persons and a 5.7% decline among transiently homeless persons, while a 10% improvement in effectiveness of treatment for latent TB infection was associated with declines of 3.0% and 3.3%, respectively. When treatment for latent TB infection was modeled to be the same in vaccinated and nonvaccinated populations, BCG vaccination led to TB case declines of 15.4% and 21.5% in chronically and transiently homeless populations, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Overcoming barriers faced by homeless individuals in accessing TB treatment programs will be crucial to reducing the burden of TB in this high-risk group. Increased treatment access, improvement in the effectiveness of treatment programs, and BCG vaccination of HIV-negative homeless individuals have the best chance to markedly decrease TB morbidity and mortality.",286,0098-7484 (Print),834-42,http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=194096,JAMA
JOUR,article,741,Will tuberculosis become resistant to all antibiotics?,2001-01-01,"The discovery of high prevalences of antibiotic resistance in some pathogens, in some parts of the world, has provoked fears of a widespread loss of drug efficacy. Here, we use a mathematical model to investigate the evolution of resistance to four major anti-tuberculosis drugs (isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol and streptomycin) in 47 sites around the world. The model provides a new method of estimating the relative risk of treatment failure for patients carrying drug-resistant strains and the proportion of patients who develop resistance after failing treatment. Using estimates of these two quantities together with other published data, we reconstructed the epidemic spread of isoniazid resistance over the past 50 years. The predicted median prevalence of resistance among new cases today was 7.0% (range 0.9-64.3%), close to the 6.3% (range 0-28.1%) observed. Predicted and observed prevalences of resistance to isoniazid plus rifampicin (multidrug-resistant or MDR-TB) after 30 years of combined drug use were also similar, 0.9% (0.1-5.9%) and 1.0% (range 0-14.1%), respectively. With current data, and under prevailing treatment practices, it appears that MDR-TB will remain a localized problem, rather than becoming a global obstacle to tuberculosis control.

This study presents a simulation model for a hypothetical hospital waiting room, in which the number of susceptible immunocompetent people in the waiting room follows a Poisson distribution (M = 5) in either low (annual number of TB patients = 5) or high TB risk settings (annual number of TB patients = 50), and used the model to evaluate the reduction of TB transmission risk by upper room UVGI. An exponential dose-response model was used for TB transmission and a two-zone model was used for evaluating the effect of upper room UVGI. Upper room UVGI reduced TB risk by 1.6-fold at 3 microW/cm2 UV irradiance in the upper room in the low TB risk setting and by 4.1-fold at 15 microW/cm2 UV irradiance in the upper room in the high TB risk setting. Use of upper room UVGI also reduced the mean annual new infection rate from 2.2 to 1.3 infections per year at 3 microW/cm2 and to 0.6 infections per year at 15 microW/cm2 in our hypothetical high-risk settings. The effect of upper room UVGI was sensitive to both vertical air velocity (air mixing) and UV irradiance level.

We examined program costs and projected savings using observed adherence and prevalence rates and literature estimates of isoniazid (INH) preventive therapy efficacy, expected INH hepatoxicity rates, and TB treatment costs; we conducted sensitivity analyses for a range of INH effectiveness, chest X-ray (CXR) referral adherence, and different strategies regarding anergy among persons affected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). For 1,000 patients offered screening, incorporating real observed program adherence rates, the program would avert $179,934 in TB treatment costs, for a net savings of $123,081. Assuming a modest risk of TB among HIV-infected anergic persons, all strategies with regard to anergy were cost saving, and the strategy of not screening for anergy and not providing DOPT to HIV-infected anergic persons resulted in the greatest cost savings. If an incentive of $25 per person increased CXR adherence from the observed 31% to 50% or 100%, over a 5-year follow-up the net cost savings would increase to $170,054 and $414,856, respectively. In this model, TB screening and DOPT at a syringe exchange is a cost-effective intervention and is cost-saving compared to costs of treating active TB cases that would have occurred in the absence of the intervention. This model is useful in evaluating the cost impact of planned program refinements, which can then be tested. Monetary incentives for those referred for screening CXRs would be justified on a cost basis if they had even a modest beneficial impact on adherence.",78,1099-3460 (Print) 1099-3460 (Linking),550-67,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&dopt=Citation&list_uids=11564856,J Urban Health
JOUR,article,592,Amplification dynamics: predicting the effect of HIV on tuberculosis outbreaks,2001-01-01,"HIV affects the pathogenesis and the transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We used a discrete event simulation model to predict the potential impact of HIV on increasing the probability and the expected severity of tuberculosis outbreaks. Our predictions reveal that an HIV epidemic can significantly increase the frequency and severity of tuberculosis outbreaks, but that this amplification effect of HIV on tuberculosis outbreaks is very sensitive to the tuberculosis treatment rate. At moderate or low treatment rates, even a moderate HIV epidemic can cause the average size of tuberculosis outbreaks to almost double in comparison with the expected outbreak size when HIV is absent. However, we determined that the amplification effect of HIV can be substantially reduced if the treatment rate of tuberculosis is very high. We discuss the significant implications of these results for the global control of tuberculosis. Our results also reveal that occasionally a ""normal-virulence"" strain of M. tuberculosis can be expected to generate a large outbreak.

Assuming 40-80% overall vaccine efficacy (64-86% for TB-meningitis) and 10 years of protection, we calculated the cost and number of immunizations required to prevent one child from developing TB, the total number of TB cases averted by vaccination and total costs required for the programme. RESULTS: Based on an assumption of flexible vaccine efficacy (40-80%), we estimated that 111-542 TB cases including 10-27 of TB-meningitis would be prevented during the 10 years after BCG vaccination among the cohort of infants born in 1996. About US$35 950-175 862 or 2125-10 399 immunizations would be required to prevent one child from developing TB. Sensitivity analyses covering a wide duration of protection, incidence of TB, vaccine coverage and discount rate, revealed that other than vaccine efficacy, the cost of preventing a single case of TB is highly sensitive to the duration of BCG protection and TB incidence. CONCLUSION: The cost per case of TB prevented is heavily dependent on vaccine efficacy and the duration of protection, and is high compared with the cost of treating one child who has developed TB.",30,0300-5771 (Print),380-385,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&dopt=Citation&list_uids=11369746,Int J Epidemiol
JOUR,article,955,The resurgence of tuberculosis in Russia,2001-01-01,"This paper documents and attempts to explain the epidemic spread of tuberculosis (TB) in Russia during the 1990s. After several decades of decline, the notification rate of all new TB cases among permanent residents increased by 7.5% per year from 1991-1999 and the death rate by 11% per year. Growth was quickest from 1993-1995 but increased again after the economic crisis of August 1998. Approximately 120 000 new cases and 30 000 deaths were reported in 1999. Case detection and cure rates have fallen in Russia since the mid-1980s; the fall has been accompanied by a higher frequency of severe disease among cases, and higher death and case fatality rates. With a mathematical model describing the deterioration in case finding and cure rates we could replicate the average rate of increase in incidence 1991-1999 but not the precise timing of the observed changes. Other factors that probably helped to shape the observed rise in caseload include enhanced transmission due to the mixing of prison and civilian populations, an increase in susceptibility to disease, and changes in the proportion of cases detected by surveillance. Although our explanation for the resurgence of TB is incomplete, we have identified a set of measures that can be implemented now to cut transmission, incidence and deaths.",356,0962-8436 (Print),1069-75,http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org.ez.lshtm.ac.uk/content/356/1411/1069.full.pdf,Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci
JOUR,article,1e3,The effect of age and study duration on the relationship between 'clustering' of DNA fingerprint patterns and the proportion of tuberculosis disease attributable to recent transmission,2001-01-01,"Though it is recognized that the extent of 'clustering' of isolates from tuberculosis cases in a given population is related to the amount of disease attributable to recent transmission, the relationship between the two statistics is poorly understood. Given age-dependent risks of disease and the fact that a long study (e.g. spanning several years) is more likely to identify transmission-linked cases than a shorter study, both measures, and thus the relationship between them, probably depend strongly on the ages of the cases ascertained and study duration. The contribution of these factors is explored in this paper using an age-structured model which describes the introduction and transmission of M. tuberculosis strains with different DNA fingerprint patterns in The Netherlands during this century, assuming that the number of individuals contacted by each case varies between cases and that DNA fingerprint patterns change over time through random mutations, as observed in several studies. Model predictions of clustering in different age groups and over different time periods between 1993 and 1997 compare well against those observed. According to the model, the proportion of young cases with onset in a given time period who were 'clustered' underestimated the proportion of disease attributable to recent transmission in this age group (by up to 25% in males); for older individuals, clustering overestimated this proportion. These under- and overestimates decreased and increased respectively as the time period over which the cases were ascertained increased. These results have important implications for the interpretation of estimates of the proportion of disease attributable to recent transmission, based on 'clustering' statistics, as are being derived from studies of the molecular epidemiology of tuberculosis in many populations.",126,NA,43-62.,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/htbin-post/Entrez/query?db=m&form=6&dopt=r&uid=11293682,Epidemiol Infect
JOUR,article,1014,A model to predict cell-mediated immune regulatory mechanisms during human infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis,2001-01-01,"A key issue for the study of tuberculosis infection (TB) is to understand why individuals infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis experience different clinical outcomes. Elaborating the immune mechanisms that determine whether an infected individual will suffer active TB or latent infection can aid in developing treatment and prevention strategies. To better understand the dynamics of M. tuberculosis infection and immunity, we have developed a virtual human model that qualitatively and quantitatively characterizes the cellular and cytokine control network operational during TB infection. Using this model, we identify key regulatory elements in the host response. In particular, factors affecting cell functions, such as macrophage activation and bactericidal capabilities, and effector T cell functions such as cytotoxicity and cytokine production can each be determinative. The model indicates, however, that even if latency is achieved, it may come at the expense of tissue damage if the response is not properly regulated. A balance in Th1 and Th2 immune responses governed by IFN-gamma, IL-10, and IL-4 facilitate this down-regulation. These results are further explored through virtual deletion and depletion experiments.",166,0022-1767 (Print) 0022-1767 (Linking),1951-1967,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11160244,J Immunol

METHODS: Monte Carlo analysis using published data on probability, cost and health impact. RESULTS: In both countries, directly observed treatment is the dominant strategy, yielding cost savings and improved health outcomes. Cost savings for directly observed treatment relative to conventional therapy become more significant as more expensive second-line drugs are used in treatments. CONCLUSIONS: The cost-effectiveness of directly observed treatment relative to conventional therapy is demonstrated for both the USA and South Africa. Cost savings are more pronounced (especially for South Africa) as the likelihood of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis increases and more expensive second-line therapies are used.

Therefore, an intervention that targets persons with recent infection, such as identifying contacts of active cases, could be particularly effective as an epidemic control measure. A mathematical model of a tuberculosis epidemic is formulated and used to evaluate the strategy of targeting therapy to persons with recently acquired latent tuberculosis infection. The model is used to quantify the effectiveness of therapy for early latent tuberculosis infection in reducing the prevalence of active tuberculosis. The model is also used to demonstrate how effective therapy for early latent tuberculosis infection has to be to eliminate tuberculosis, when used in conjunction with therapy for active tuberculosis.

JOUR,article,718,"[A mathematical model of the annual risk of tuberculosis infection in Cali, Colombia]",2002-01-01,"OBJECTIVE: The annual risk of infection (ARI) for tuberculosis is the probability that an individual without previous contact with the tubercle bacillus has of being infected during the course of a year. The ARI is the most appropriate indicator for estimating the degree of tuberculosis infection in a population. The objective of this paper was to estimate the ARI and its trends in the city of Cali, Colombia, using data provided by the Municipal Secretariat of Health. METHODS: We used a deterministic model of the dynamics of pulmonary tuberculosis. The flows among the population subgroups were based on the natural history of the disease, taking vaccination into account. Using the data from the Municipal Secretariat of Health, we estimated the initial conditions and the values of the parameters. RESULTS: The mean ARI values were 1.24% in the 1970s, 0.93% in the 1980s, and 0.85% in the 1990s. In order to assess trends, we attempted to predict the annual risk, utilizing a nonlinear least-squares adjustment of the data on the overall percentage for each year. With that approach, we projected that the ARI in 2003 would be 1.3%, indicating a return to the patterns found in the 1970s. CONCLUSIONS: The estimated risk of tuberculosis infection in Cali during the decades of the 1970s, the 1980s, and the 1990s was very high in comparison with the risk in countries such as the Netherlands, which in 1985 had an ARI of 0.012%. However, the ARI in Cali is not so high in comparison to indices for other countries of South America, which range from 0.5% to 1.5%. This model and the simulation it produced showed a rising trend in the ARI for Cali, as well as demonstrated that the ARI will tend to continue to rise if control measures are not improved.",11,1020-4989 (Print),166-171,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&dopt=Citation&list_uids=11998182,Rev Panam Salud Publica

JOUR,article,780,A reiterative method for calculating the early bactericidal activity of antituberculosis drugs,2002-01-01,"Studies of early bactericidal activity (EBA) are important in the rapid evaluation of new antituberculosis drugs. Historically, these have concentrated on the log fall in the viable count in sputum during the first 48 hours of therapy. In this paper, we provide a mathematical model that suggests that the viable count in sputum follows an exponential decay curve with the equation V = S + Me(-kt) (where V is the viable count, M the population of bacteria susceptible to the test drug, S the population susceptible only to sterilizing agents, t the day of sputum collection as related to start of therapy, k the rate constant for the bacteria killed each day, and e the Napierian constant). We demonstrate that data from clinical trials fits the exponential decay model. We propose that future EBA studies should be performed by measuring daily quantitative counts for at least 5 days. We also propose that the comparison of the early bactericidal activity of antituberculosis drugs should be evaluated using the time taken to reduce the viable count by 50% (vt(50)). A further reiterative refinement following a rule set based on statistically the best fit to the exponential decay model is described that will allow investigators to identify anomalous results and thus enhance the accuracy in measuring early bactericidal activity.",166,1073-449X (Print),31-5,http://ajrccm.atsjournals.org/content/166/1/31.full.pdf,Am J Respir Crit Care Med

JOUR,article,588,Determinants of cluster distribution in the molecular epidemiology of tuberculosis,2002-01-01,"Recently developed molecular techniques have revolutionized the epidemiology of tuberculosis. Multiple studies have used these tools to examine the population structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates in different communities. The distributions of clusters of M. tuberculosis isolates in these settings may variously reflect social mixing patterns or the differential fitness of specific clones of the organism. We developed an individual-based microsimulation of tuberculosis transmission to explore social and demographic determinants of cluster distribution and to observe the effect of transmission dynamics on the empiric data from molecular epidemiologic studies. Our results demonstrate that multiple host-related factors contribute to wide variation in cluster distributions even when all strains of the organism are assumed to be equally transmissible. These host characteristics include interventions such as chemotherapy, vaccination and chemoprophylaxis, HIV prevalence, the age structure of the population, and the prevalence of latent tuberculosis infection.

METHODS: The incidence of tuberculosis (all forms) in the period 1970 to 2030 was estimated using a life-table model for the Dutch population without the impact of immigration. The influence of immigration on tuberculosis incidence among the Dutch was modelled using four immigrant scenarios, distinguished by the assumed contact rate between immigrants and the Dutch population, and by different projections (middle, upper) of the future size of the immigrant population in The Netherlands. RESULTS: The incidence of smear-positive tuberculosis among the Dutch is projected to be 1.4 per million in the scenario without the influence of immigrant cases, and ranging from 3.8 to 11.8 per million in the four immigrant scenarios. In all immigrant scenarios, the prevalence of tuberculosis infection will continue to decline and be less than 1% by the year 2030. At least 60% of Dutch tuberculosis cases in the year 2030 are expected to be the result of transmission from a foreign source case. CONCLUSION: Using a prevalence of tuberculosis infection of less than 1% as the elimination criterion, tuberculosis will probably be eliminated from the indigenous Dutch population by 2030. However, the incidence of smear-positive tuberculosis is expected to remain higher than 1 per million, and the majority of new tuberculosis cases among the Dutch may be attributable to recent infection from a foreign source case.",6,1027-3719 (Print),130-6,NA,International Journal of Tuberculosis and Lung Disease

Phylogenetic analysis using these ""comparative-genome markers"" (CGMs) produced a highly unusual phylogeny with a complete absence of secondary branches. To investigate CGM-based phylogenies, we devised computer models to simulate sequence evolution and calculate new phylogenies based on an SNP format. We found that CGMs represent a distinct class of phylogenetic markers that depend critically on the genetic distances between compared ""reference strains."" Properly distanced reference strains generate CGMs that accurately depict evolutionary relationships, distorted only by branch collapse. Improperly distanced reference strains generate CGMs that distort and reroot outgroups. Applying this understanding to the CGM-based phylogeny of M. tuberculosis, we found evidence to suggest that this species is highly clonal without detectable lateral gene exchange. We noted indications of evolutionary bottlenecks, including one at the level of the PHRI ""C"" strain previously associated with particular virulence characteristics. Our evidence also suggests that loss of IS6110 to fewer than seven elements per genome is uncommon.

JOUR,article,651,The transmission of tuberculosis in confined spaces: an analytical review of alternative epidemiological models,2003-01-01,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease that is closely associated with poverty, with transmission occurring in situations where infected persons are in close contact with others in confined spaces. While it is well recognised that overcrowding increases the risk of transmission, this increased risk has not been quantified and the relationship between overcrowding and duration of exposure is not well understood. This paper analyses three epidemiological models that have been used to predict the transmission of airborne disease in confined spaces: the Mass Action model, Riley, Murphy and Riley's model and Gammaitoni and Nucci's model. A study is presented to demonstrate the range of applicability of each model and show how they can be applied to the transmission of both TB and diseases with short incubation periods such as measles. Gammiatoni and Nucci's generalised formulation is shown to be the most suitable for modelling airborne transmission in ventilated spaces, and it is subsequently used in a parametric study to evaluate the effect of physical and environmental factors on the rate of disease transmission.

METHODS: We reviewed data from notifications of TB cases, cohort treatment outcomes, surveys of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, and HIV prevalence in patients with TB and other subgroups. Information was collated from published literature and databases held by the World Health Organization (WHO), the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (UNAIDS), the US Census Bureau, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. RESULTS: There were an estimated 8.3 million (5th-95th centiles, 7.3-9.2 million) new TB cases in 2000 (137/100,000 population; range, 121/100,000-151/100,000). Tuberculosis incidence rates were highest in the WHO African Region (290/100,000 per year; range, 265/100,000-331/100,000), as was the annual rate of increase in the number of cases (6%). Nine percent (7%-12%) of all new TB cases in adults (aged 15-49 years) were attributable to HIV infection, but the proportion was much greater in the WHO African Region (31%) and some industrialized countries, notably the United States (26%). There were an estimated 1.8 million (5th-95th centiles, 1.6-2.2 million) deaths from TB, of which 12% (226 000) were attributable to HIV. Tuberculosis was the cause of 11% of all adult AIDS deaths. The prevalence of M tuberculosis-HIV coinfection in adults was 0.36% (11 million people). Coinfection prevalence rates equaled or exceeded 5% in 8 African countries. In South Africa alone there were 2 million coinfected adults. CONCLUSIONS: The HIV pandemic presents a massive challenge to global TB control.

DESIGN AND METHODS: A compartmental difference equation model of TB and HIV has been developed and fitted to time series and other published data using Bayesian methods. The model is used to compare the effectiveness of TB chemotherapy with three strategies for prevention: highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the treatment of latent TB infection (TLTI) and the reduction of HIV transmission. RESULTS: Even where the prevalence of HIV infection is high, finding and curing active TB is the most effective way to minimize the number of TB cases and deaths over the next 10 years. HAART can be as effective, but only with very high levels of coverage and compliance. TLTI is comparatively ineffective over all time scales. Reducing HIV incidence is relatively ineffective in preventing TB and TB deaths over 10 years but is much more effective over 20 years. CONCLUSIONS: In countries where the spread of HIV has led to a substantial increase in the incidence of TB, TB control programmes should maintain a strong emphasis on the treatment of active TB. To ensure effective control of TB in the longer term, methods of TB prevention should be carried out in addition to, but not as a substitute for, treating active cases.",17,0269-9370 (Print),2501-8,http://graphics.tx.ovid.com/ovftpdfs/FPDDNCDCLFEDDD00/fs046/ovft/live/gv023/00002030/00002030-200311210-00013.pdf,AIDS

MTD sensitivity, specificity, and probability of inhibition for smear-positive specimens were estimated from literature reports. Costs and laboratory performance characteristics were determined from review of records and practices at an urban hospital in the mid-Atlantic United States. In the base case, 31.4% of smear-positive specimens were assumed to be culture positive for M. tuberculosis. Under these conditions, the marginal cost of the MTD testing program was estimated as $338 per smear-positive patient, or $494 per early exclusion of tuberculosis based on negative MTD results. By comparison, the cost of respiratory isolation ($27.77/day) and drugs ($5.66/day) averted by MTD testing was estimated at $201 per early tuberculosis exclusion. MTD testing was therefore not cost-effective in this scenario. Sensitivity analysis revealed that cost-effectiveness estimates are sensitive to the number of smear-positive specimens processed annually, the relative prevalence of M. tuberculosis in smear-positive specimens, and the marginal daily cost of respiratory isolation. A decision tool is therefore presented for assessing the cost-effectiveness of MTD under various combinations of those three variables. While routine MTD testing of smear-positive specimens is not expected to be cost-saving for most individual hospitals, centralized reference laboratories may be able to implement MTD in a cost-effective manner across a wide range of situations.",41,NA,948-953,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&dopt=Citation&list_uids=12624014file://C:\literature_pdf\rm11132.pdf,Journal of clinical microbiology
JOUR,article,798,A cost-effectiveness analysis of universal versus selective immunization with Mycobacterium bovis bacille Calmette-Guerin in Finland,2003-01-01,"SETTING: Mycobacterium bovis bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is provided to all infants born in Finland. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the cost-effectiveness of universal versus selective BCG immunization. DESIGN: A Markov model was developed to simulate rates of tuberculosis (TB) and non-tuberculous mycobacterial disease (NTM), and to examine the cost-effectiveness in terms of cost per case averted of three different strategies: universal BCG, selective BCG (10% of infants at higher TB risk than other infants) or no BCG immunization. RESULTS: In a cohort of 60,000 infants over 15 years, the model predicts five cases each of TB and NTM disease with universal immunization, 8-21 TB and 31 NTM cases with various strategies of selective immunization, and 25 TB and 34 NTM cases with no BCG immunization. BCG side-effects are predicted in 5, 0.5 and 0 infants, respectively. The cost per case averted for immunization strategies ranges from a cost of 38,311 US dollars to a savings of 323 dollars as selective immunization becomes more efficient at targeting infants at highest risk of TB. CONCLUSIONS: In a country with a low incidence of pediatric tuberculosis, selective BCG immunization is a more cost-effective strategy than universal BCG immunization for the prevention of tuberculosis, but results in an increase in NTM cases.",7,1027-3719 (Print),22-29,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&dopt=Citation&list_uids=12701831,International Journal of Tuberculosis and Lung Disease

A decision analysis,2003-01-01,"Recent data indicate that 10- to 14-mm Mycobacterium tuberculosis purified protein derivative (PPD) reactions are often due to prior infections with nontuberculous mycobacteria. Therefore, use of a 10-mm cutpoint to define latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) results in false-positive diagnoses and unnecessary treatment for LTBI. A second skin test, Mycobacterium avium sensitin (MAS), has been shown to accurately identify false-positive PPD results.To compare the costs and accuracy of a single skin-test strategy (SST) with PPD alone with a dual skin-test strategy (DST) where 10- to 14-mm PPD results are also tested with MAS.A decision analytic model was developed to evaluate the two strategies. The model accounted for the costs of skin testing, the costs of LTBI treatment, the costs of undetected LTBI, and the sensitivity and specificity of each strategy.We estimated that DST saved $3 per subject tested compared to SST. Savings were due to a reduction in false-positive PPD results and consequent reduction in unnecessary treatment for LTBI of >60%. The DST strategy was associated with a minimal increase in undetected LTBI (6% vs 7%). Results were stable for a broad range of parameter values.DST is a promising approach to improving the specificity of LTBI testing when a 10-mm PPD cutpoint is used and would reduce costs and unnecessary drug treatment.",24,NA,254-9,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&dopt=Citation&list_uids=12657344,American Journal of Preventive Medicine

DESIGN: Decision analysis with Monte Carlo simulation of a Markov decision tree. DATA SOURCES: People with smear positive pulmonary tuberculosis. DATA ANALYSIS: Analyses modelled different levels of programme effectiveness of DOTS and DOTS-plus, and high (10%) and intermediate (3%) proportions of primary multidrug resistant tuberculosis, while accounting for exogenous reinfection. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The cumulative number of tuberculosis deaths per 100 000 population over 10 years. RESULTS: The model predicted that under DOTS, 276 people would die from tuberculosis (24 multidrug resistant and 252 not multidrug resistant) over 10 years under optimal implementation in an area with 3% primary multidrug resistant tuberculosis. Optimal implementation of DOTS-plus would result in four (1.5%) fewer deaths.

Using a model of introduction and transmission of strains with different DNA fingerprint patterns, we show that the properties and interpretation of clustering statistics may differ substantially between settings. For some unindustrialized countries, where the annual risk for infection has changed little over time, 70% to 80% of all age groups may be clustered during a 3-year period, which underestimates the proportion of disease attributable to recent transmission. In contrast, for a typical industrialized setting (the Netherlands), clustering declines with increasing age (from 75% to 15% among young and old patients, respectively) and underestimates the extent of recent transmission only for young patients.

DESIGN: A model of the outcome of patients screened using each diagnostic algorithm was established using published costs and performance data for each component of the algorithm. Direct health care provider costs associated with provision of each diagnostic strategy were determined. Overall performance, total cost, speed and accuracy of diagnosis were estimated for screening 1000 new TB suspects using each algorithm.

We reconstruct possible evolutionary trajectories that generated hot zones over the past three decades, and identify the key causal factors. Results are consistent with recently reported World Health Organization (WHO) data. Our analyses yield three important insights. First, paradoxically we found that areas with programs that successfully reduced wild-type pansensitive strains often evolved into hot zones. Second, some hot zones emerged even when MDR strains were substantially less fit (and thus less transmissible) than wild-type pansensitive strains. Third, levels of MDR are driven by case-finding rates, cure rates and amplification probabilities.

JOUR,article,703,Modeling epidemics of multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis of heterogeneous fitness,2004-01-01,"Mathematical models have recently been used to predict the future burden of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDRTB). These models suggest the threat of multidrug resistance to TB control will depend on the relative 'fitness' of MDR strains and imply that if the average fitness of MDR strains is considerably less than that of drug-sensitive strains, the emergence of resistance will not jeopardize the success of tuberculosis control efforts. Multidrug resistance in M. tuberculosis is conferred by the sequential acquisition of a number of different single-locus mutations that have been shown to have heterogeneous phenotypic effects. Here we model the impact of initial fitness estimates on the emergence of MDRTB assuming that the relative fitness of MDR strains is heterogeneous. We find that even when the average relative fitness of MDR strains is low and a well-functioning control program is in place, a small subpopulation of a relatively fit MDR strain may eventually outcompete both the drug-sensitive strains and the less fit MDR strains. These results imply that current epidemiological measures and short-term trends in the burden of MDRTB do not provide evidence that MDRTB strains can be contained in the absence of specific efforts to limit transmission from those with MDR disease.",10,1078-8956 (Print),1117-21,http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/v10/n10/pdf/nm1110.pdf,Nat Med

JOUR,article,777,Understanding tuberculosis epidemiology using structured statistical models,2004-01-01,"Molecular epidemiological studies can provide novel insights into the transmission of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis. Typically, risk factors for transmission are identified using traditional hypothesis-driven statistical methods such as logistic regression. However, limitations become apparent in these approaches as the scope of these studies expand to include additional epidemiological and bacterial genomic data. Here we examine the use of Bayesian models to analyze tuberculosis epidemiology. We begin by exploring the use of Bayesian networks (BNs) to identify the distribution of tuberculosis patient attributes (including demographic and clinical attributes). Using existing algorithms for constructing BNs from observational data, we learned a BN from data about tuberculosis patients collected in San Francisco from 1991 to 1999. We verified that the resulting probabilistic models did in fact capture known statistical relationships. Next, we examine the use of newly introduced methods for representing and automatically constructing probabilistic models in structured domains. We use statistical relational models (SRMs) to model distributions over relational domains. SRMs are ideally suited to richly structured epidemiological data. We use a data-driven method to construct a statistical relational model directly from data stored in a relational database. The resulting model reveals the relationships between variables in the data and describes their distribution. We applied this procedure to the data on tuberculosis patients in San Francisco from 1991 to 1999, their Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains, and data on contact investigations. The resulting statistical relational model corroborated previously reported findings and revealed several novel associations. These models illustrate the potential for this approach to reveal relationships within richly structured data that may not be apparent using conventional statistical approaches. We show that Bayesian methods, in particular statistical relational models, are an important tool for understanding infectious disease epidemiology.",30,NA,233-256,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&dopt=Citation&list_uids=15081074,Artificial Intelligence in Medicine
JOUR,article,785,The reinfection threshold promotes variability in tuberculosis epidemiology and vaccine efficacy,2004-01-01,"Population patterns of infection are determined largely by susceptibility to infection. Infection and vaccination induce an immune response that, typically, reduces susceptibility to subsequent infections. With a general epidemic model, we detect a 'reinfection threshold', above which reinfection is the principal type of transmission and, consequently, infection levels are much higher and vaccination fails. The model is further developed to address human tuberculosis (TB) and the impact of vaccination. The bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is the only vaccine in current use against TB, and there is no consensus about its usefulness. Estimates of protection range from 0 to 80%, and this variability is aggravated by an association between low vaccine efficacy and high prevalence of the disease. We propose an explanation based on three postulates: (i) the potential for transmission varies between populations, owing to differences in socio-economic and environmental factors; (ii) exposure to mycobacteria induces an immune response that is partially protective against reinfection; and (iii) this protection is not significantly improved by BCG vaccination. These postulates combine to reproduce the observed trends, and this is attributed to a reinfection threshold intrinsic to the transmission dynamics. Finally, we demonstrate how reinfection thresholds can be manipulated by vaccination programmes, suggesting that they have a potentially powerful role in global control.",271,0962-8452 (Print),617-23,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15156920,Proc Biol Sci

To optimize moxifloxacin dose and dose regimen, pharmacodynamic antibiotic-exposure targets associated with maximal microbial kill and complete suppression of drug resistance in M. tuberculosis must be identified. METHODS: We used a novel in vitro pharmacodynamic infection model of tuberculosis in which we exposed M. tuberculosis to moxifloxacin with a pharmacokinetic half-life of decline similar to that encountered in humans. Data obtained from this model were mathematically modeled, and the drug-exposure breakpoint associated with the suppression of drug resistance was determined. Monte-Carlo simulations were performed to determine the probability that 10,000 clinical patients taking different doses of moxifloxacin would achieve or exceed the drug-exposure breakpoint needed to suppress resistance to moxifloxacin in M. tuberculosis. RESULTS: The ratio of the moxifloxacin-free (non-protein-bound) area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h to the minimum inhibitory concentration associated with complete suppression of the drug-resistant mutant population was 53. For patients taking moxifloxacin doses of 400, 600, or 800 mg/day, the calculated target-attainment rates to suppress drug resistance were 59%, 86%, and 93%, respectively.

We assume that the present status of TB and the emergence of drug-resistant TB in Thailand are the consequence of past epidemics. Control strategies in the model are defined by specifying the value of the effective treatment rate (baseline value = 0.74) and the relative treatment efficacy (baseline value = 0.84). It is predicted that the total number of new TB cases would continue to decrease at the current level of intervention. Although a dramatic decline in the incidence rate of drug-sensitive cases is expected, drug-resistant cases are predicted to increase gradually, so that more than half of the TB strains would not be drug-sensitive after 2020. The prediction is not greatly altered by improving the interventions. They could, however, delay the emergence of drug-resistant strains for a few years. Our study demonstrates it would be impossible to avoid the continued emergence of drug-resistant TB in the future.

For those without evidence of infection at entry, the most cost-effective screening interval was 1 year for high-risk groups, 2 years for moderate-risk groups, and 5 years for low-risk groups, with a net savings $0.20 to $26 per HCW per year. Screening at a more frequent interval was still cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: For HCWs found to be tuberculin reactors, treatment of their latent infection is to their benefit and is associated with a net cost-savings. Regular tuberculin screening of HCWs can be cost-effective or result in a net cost-savings. Each institution could use its own skin test surveillance data to create an optimum screening program for its employees. However, for most HCWs, a 1-year screening interval would be a cost-effective and safe choice.",25,0899-823X (Print) 0899-823X (Linking),1056-61,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&dopt=Citation&list_uids=15636292http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdf/10.1086/502343,Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol
JOUR,article,951,Identifying control mechanisms of granuloma formation during M. tuberculosis infection using an agent-based model,2004-01-01,"Infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a major world health problem. An estimated 2 billion people are presently infected and the disease causes approximately 3 million deaths per year. After bacteria are inhaled into the lung, a complex immune response is triggered leading to the formation of multicellular structures termed granulomas. It is believed that the collection of host granulomas either contain bacteria resulting in a latent infection or are unable to do so, leading to active disease. Thus, understanding granuloma formation and function is essential for improving both diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis. Granuloma formation is a complex spatio-temporal system involving interactions of bacteria, specific immune cells, including macrophages, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, as well as immune effectors such as chemokine and cytokines. To study this complex dynamical system we have developed an agent-based model of granuloma formation in the lung. This model combines continuous representations of chemokines with discrete agent representations of macrophages and T cells in a cellular automata-like environment. Our results indicate that key host elements involved in granuloma formation are chemokine diffusion, prevention of macrophage overcrowding within the granuloma, arrival time, location and number of T cells within the granuloma, and an overall host ability to activate macrophages. Interestingly, a key bacterial factor is its intracellular growth rate, whereby slow growth actually facilitates survival.",231,0022-5193 (Print),357-76,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15501468,J Theor Biol
JOUR,article,980,Evidence for positive selection on Mycobacterium tuberculosis within patients,2004-01-01,"BACKGROUND: While the pathogenesis and epidemiology of tuberculosis are well studied, relatively little is known about the evolution of the infectious agent Mycobacterium tuberculosis, especially at the within-host level. The insertion sequence IS6110 is a genetic marker that is widely used to track the transmission of tuberculosis between individuals. This and other markers may also facilitate our understanding of the disease within patients. RESULTS: This article presents three lines of evidence supporting the action of positive selection on M. tuberculosis within patients. The arguments are based on a comparison between empirical findings from molecular epidemiology, and population genetic models of evolution. Under the hypothesis of neutrality of genotypes, 1) the mutation rate of the marker IS6110 is unusually high, 2) the time it takes for substitutions to occur within patients is too short, and 3) the amount of polymorphism within patients is too low. CONCLUSIONS: Empirical observations are explained by the action of positive selection during infection, or alternatively by very low effective population sizes. I discuss the possible roles of antibiotic treatment, the host immune system and extrapulmonary dissemination in creating opportunities for positive selection.",4,NA,31,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&dopt=Citation&list_uids=15355550,Bio Med Central Evolutionary Biology

We use mathematical models to predict the potential public health impact of new TB vaccines in high-incidence countries. We show that preexposure vaccines would be almost twice as effective as postexposure vaccines in reducing the number of new infections. Postexposure vaccines would initially have a substantially greater impact, compared to preexposure vaccines, on reducing the number of new cases of disease. However, the effectiveness of postexposure vaccines would diminish over time, whereas the effectiveness of preexposure vaccines would increase. Thus, after 20 to 30 years, post- or preexposure vaccination campaigns would be almost equally effective in terms of cumulative TB cases prevented. Even widely deployed and highly effective (50%-90% efficacy) pre- or postexposure vaccines would only be able to reduce the number of TB cases by one third.

JOUR,article,635,Impact of an effective multidrug-resistant tuberculosis control programme in the setting of an immature HIV epidemic: system dynamics simulation model,2005-01-01,"This study sought to determine the impact of an effective programme of multidrug resistant tuberculosis control (MDRTB) on a population that is witnessing an explosive HIV epidemic among injecting drug users (IDUs), where the prevalence of MDRTB is already high. A transmission model was constructed that represents the dynamics of the drug-susceptible tuberculosis (DSTB), MDRTB and HIV spread among the adult population of Samara Oblast, Russia: from official notifications of tuberculosis and of HIV infection, estimates of MDRTB derived from surveillance studies, population data from official regional statistics, data on transmission probabilities from peer-reviewed publications and informed estimates, and policy-makers' estimates of IDU populations. Two scenarios of programme effectiveness for MDRTB were modelled and run over a period of 10 years to predict cumulative deaths. In a population of 3.3 million with a high prevalence of MDRTB, an emerging epidemic of HIV among IDUs, and a functioning directly observed therapy-short course (DOTS) programme, the model predicts that under low cure rates for MDRTB the expected cumulative deaths from tuberculosis will reach 6303 deaths including 1900 deaths from MDRTB at 10 years. Under high cure rate for MDRTB 4465 deaths will occur including 134 deaths from MDRTB. At 10 years there is little impact on HIV-infected populations from the MDRTB epidemic, but as the HIV epidemic matures the impact becomes substantial. When the model is extended to 20 years cumulative deaths from MDRTB become very high if cure rates for MDRTB are low and cumulative deaths in the HIV-infected population, likewise, are profoundly affected. In the presence of an immature HIV epidemic failure to actively control MDRTB may result in approximately a third more deaths than if effective treatment is given. As the HIV epidemic matures then the impact of MDRTB grows substantially if MDRTB control strategies are ineffective. The epidemiological starting point for these scenarios is present in many regions within the former Soviet Union and this analysis suggests control of MDRTB should be an urgent priority.",16,0956-4624 (Print),560-70,http://ijsa.rsmjournals.com/content/16/8/560,Int J STD AIDS

DESIGN: Cost effectiveness analysis based on an epidemiological model. SETTING: Analyses undertaken for two regions classified by WHO according to their epidemiological grouping-Afr-E, countries in sub-Saharan Africa with very high adult and high child mortality, and Sear-D, countries in South East Asia with high adult and high child mortality. DATA SOURCES: Published studies, costing databases, expert opinion. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs per disability adjusted life year (DALY) averted in 2000 international dollars (dollarsInt). RESULTS: Treatment of new cases of smear-positive tuberculosis in DOTS programmes cost dollarsInt6-8 per DALY averted in Afr-E and dollarsInt7 per DALY averted in Sear-D at coverage levels of 50-95%. In Afr-E, adding treatment of smear-negative and extra-pulmonary cases at a coverage level of 95% cost dollarsInt95 per DALY averted; the addition of DOTS-Plus treatment for multidrug resistant cases cost dollarsInt123. In Sear-D, these costs were dollarsInt52 and dollarsInt226, respectively. The full combination of interventions could reduce prevalence and mortality by over 50% in Sear-D between 1990 and 2010, and by almost 50% between 2000 and 2010 in Afr-E. CONCLUSIONS: DOTS treatment of new smear-positive cases is the first priority in tuberculosis control, including in countries with high HIV prevalence. DOTS treatment of smear-negative and extra-pulmonary cases and DOTS-Plus treatment of multidrug resistant cases are also highly cost effective.

JOUR,article,559,"Cost, affordability and cost-effectiveness of strategies to control tuberculosis in countries with high HIV prevalence",2005-01-01,"BACKGROUND: The HIV epidemic has caused a dramatic increase in tuberculosis (TB) in East and southern Africa. Several strategies have the potential to reduce the burden of TB in high HIV prevalence settings, and cost and cost-effectiveness analyses can help to prioritize them when budget constraints exist. However, published cost and cost-effectiveness studies are limited. METHODS: Our objective was to compare the cost, affordability and cost-effectiveness of seven strategies for reducing the burden of TB in countries with high HIV prevalence. A compartmental difference equation model of TB and HIV and recent cost data were used to assess the costs (year 2003 USD prices) and effects (TB cases averted, deaths averted, DALYs gained) of these strategies in Kenya during the period 2004-2023. RESULTS: The three lowest cost and most cost-effective strategies were improving TB cure rates, improving TB case detection rates, and improving both together. The incremental cost of combined improvements to case detection and cure was below USD 15 million per year (7.5% of year 2000 government health expenditure); the mean cost per DALY gained of these three strategies ranged from USD 18 to USD 34. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) had the highest incremental costs, which by 2007 could be as large as total government health expenditures in year 2000. ART could also gain more DALYs than the other strategies, at a cost per DALY gained of around USD 260 to USD 530. Both the costs and effects of treatment for latent tuberculosis infection (TLTI) for HIV+ individuals were low; the cost per DALY gained ranged from about USD 85 to USD 370. Averting one HIV infection for less than USD 250 would be as cost-effective as improving TB case detection and cure rates to WHO target levels. CONCLUSION: To reduce the burden of TB in high HIV prevalence settings, the immediate goal should be to increase TB case detection rates and, to the extent possible, improve TB cure rates, preferably in combination. Realising the full potential of ART will require substantial new funding and strengthening of health system capacity so that increased funding can be used effectively.",5,1471-2458 (Electronic),130,http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/5/130,BMC Public Health
JOUR,article,725,Cost-effectiveness of isoniazid chemoprevention in close contacts,2005-01-01,"The aim of the present study was to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis in young and middle-aged adults with latent tuberculosis (TB) infection in Germany. A Markov model simulated the progression of 20- and 40-yr-old close contacts of active TB cases over 20 yrs. Health and economic outcomes of isoniazid (INH) chemoprevention versus no intervention were compared. The analysis determined the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life year and the difference between numbers of TB cases and of TB-related deaths. INH chemoprevention prevented 79% of expected TB cases in both age groups, and saved 9,482 and 9,142 in the lower and higher age groups, respectively, per case prevented. Quality-adjusted life expectancy was slightly extended by 8 days in the lower age group and 7 days in the higher age group, at a cost saving of 417 and 375, respectively, per person. Annual savings were 20,862 and 18,742 per 1,000 contacts, respectively. The number needed to be treated to prevent one TB case in the lower age group was 23 and 25 in the higher age group. The programme also prevented three TB-related deaths in the younger and two in the older cohort. The results are highly sensitive to treatment-cost assumptions. In conclusion, isoniazid chemoprevention in Germany is a highly cost-effective approach for reducing the burden of tuberculosis in recently converted young and middle-aged adults.",26,NA,465-473,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&dopt=Citation&list_uids=16135730,European Respiratory Journal

The model has been studied qualitatively using stability theory of nonlinear differential equations. It is shown that the positive co?infection equilibrium is always locally stable but it may become globally stable under certain conditions showing that the disease becomes endemic due to constant migration of the population into the habitat.

METHODS: Using decision analysis, we estimated tuberculosis-related morbidity, mortality, and costs among legal immigrants and refugees, undocumented migrants, and temporary visitors from Mexico after their entry into the United States. We assessed the current strategy of radiographic screening of legal immigrants plus current tuberculosis-control programs alone and with the addition of either U.S.-funded expansion of the strategy of directly observed treatment, short course (DOTS), in Mexico or tuberculin skin testing to screen legal immigrants from Mexico. We also examined tuberculosis-related outcomes among migrants from Haiti and the Dominican Republic using the same three strategies. RESULTS: As compared with the current strategy, expanding the DOTS program in Mexico at a cost to the United States of 34.9 million dollars would result in 2591 fewer cases of tuberculosis in the United States, with 349 fewer deaths from the disease and net discounted savings of 108 million dollars over a 20-year period. Adding tuberculin skin testing to radiographic screening of legal immigrants from Mexico would result in 401 fewer cases of tuberculosis in the United States but would cost an additional 329 million dollars. Expansion of the DOTS program would remain cost saving even if the initial investment were doubled, if the United States paid for all antituberculosis drugs in Mexico, or if the decline in the incidence of tuberculosis in Mexico was less than projected. A 9.4 million dollars investment to expand the DOTS program in Haiti and the Dominican Republic would result in net U.S. savings of 20 million dollars over a 20-year period. CONCLUSIONS: U.S.-funded efforts to expand the DOTS program in Mexico, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic could reduce tuberculosis-related morbidity and mortality among migrants to the United States, producing net cost savings for the United States.",353,1533-4406 (Electronic),1008-20,http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMsa043194,N Engl J Med
JOUR,article,611,The impact of HIV/AIDS on the control of tuberculosis in India,2005-01-01,"Epidemics of HIV/AIDS have increased the tuberculosis (TB) case-load by five or more times in East Africa and southern Africa. As HIV continues to spread, warnings have been issued of disastrous AIDS and TB epidemics in ""new-wave"" countries, including India, which accounts for 20% of all new TB cases arising in the world each year. Here we investigate whether, in the face of the HIV epidemic, India's Revised National TB Control Program (RNTCP) could halve TB prevalence and death rates in the period 1990-2015, as specified by the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. Using a mathematical model to capture the spatial and temporal variation in TB and HIV in India, we predict that, without the RNTCP, HIV would increase TB prevalence (by 1%), incidence (by 12%), and mortality rates (by 33%) between 1990 and 2015. With the RNTCP, however, we expect substantial reductions in prevalence (by 68%), incidence (by 41%), and mortality (by 39%) between 1990 and 2015. In India, 29% of adults but 72% of HIV-positive adults live in four large states in the south where, even with the RNTCP, mortality is expected to fall by only 15% between 1990 and 2015. Nationally, the RNTCP should be able to reverse the increases in TB burden due to HIV but, to ensure that TB mortality is reduced by 50% or more by 2015, HIV-infected TB patients should be provided with antiretroviral therapy in addition to the recommended treatment for TB.",102,0027-8424 (Print),9619-24,http://www.pnas.org/content/102/27/9619.full.pdf,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA

Cost and outcome values were discounted. Quality of life was considered. Acceptability curves summarized uncertainties. Sensitivity analyses tested assumptions. Results showed that triple antiretroviral therapy (ARV) plus antibiotics would prolong life by 6.7 undiscounted years if provided 'late' (CD4 = 200 cells/microl) and by 9.8 years if provided 'early' (CD4 = 350 cells/microl).

The discounted incremental costs per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained were, respectively, $29 saving, $254, $4937 and $3057.

Given the low risk for exposure, the high susceptibility of infants to M. tuberculosis infection, and the possibility of hepatotoxicity due to isoniazid therapy, a decision analysis model was used to determine whether administration of isoniazid prophylaxis against tuberculosis is preferable to no administration of prophylaxis. DESIGN: A decision analysis tree was constructed with software, using probabilities from the literature and costs from local health facilities. The expected values for each strategy were obtained, and sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: For the strategy in which prophylaxis was administered under direct observation (DO), the probability for survival was 0.999980. For the strategy in which no prophylaxis was administered, the probability of survival was 0.999950, which corresponds to 3 more deaths per 100,000 patients than with the DO prophylaxis strategy. The incremental cost-effectiveness of the DO prophylaxis strategy was 21,710,000 US dollars per death prevented. Sensitivity analysis for survival showed that the DO prophylaxis strategy was preferable to the strategy in which no prophylaxis is given if the probability of infection was >0.0002, the probability of tuberculous disease in an infected infant who did not receive prophylaxis was greater than 0.12, the probability of dying from tuberculosis was greater than 0.025, the probability of hepatotoxicity was less than 0.004, and the probability of dying from hepatotoxicity was less than 0.04. For the strategy in which prophylaxis was administered under non-DO conditions (ie, by parents), the incremental cost-effectiveness was 929,500 US dollars per death prevented, which is approximately 5% of the incremental cost-effectiveness of the DO prophylaxis strategy.

All are complicated by prior sensitisation to environmental mycobacteria and bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination. Mixture analysis has recently been proposed as a means of overcoming misclassification and improving infection prevalence estimates. OBJECTIVE: To compare conventional and mixture model estimates of M. tuberculosis infection prevalence. DESIGN: Mixture models with two or three univariate normal components were fitted to the results of 53 909 tuberculin tests conducted in northern Malawi during 1980-1984. Data were stratified by BCG status, sex and age and corrected for digit preference. Prevalence estimates derived from mixture models were compared with those of conventional methods. RESULTS: The optimal model was age-dependent, with three- and one-component solutions preferred in younger and older age groups, respectively. In contrast with findings from elsewhere, a component corresponding to BCG vaccination was indistinguishable from that attributable to environmental mycobacterial exposure, and infection prevalence estimates in younger individuals with a BCG scar were inflated, irrespective of the method used. CONCLUSION: The validity of infection prevalence and incidence estimates based on mixture modelling is probably locale-dependent, and the assumptions underlying mixture models may not realistically reflect underlying immunological processes.",10,1027-3719 (Print),1023-9,NA,International Journal of Tuberculosis and Lung Disease

METHODS: Simulations were carried out using a model derived from a large SSCC dataset. Variance inflation factors (VIFs) were calculated for model parameters, focusing on the elimination rate constant likely to reflect 'sterilizing' activity and sampling schemes were optimized relative to a scheme of daily sampling during the initial phase of therapy. Corresponding sample sizes required for SSCC studies using different schemes were also computed. RESULTS: Published sampling schemes lacked efficiency with respect to the 'sterilizing' phase. Pragmatic optimized schemes yielding greatest precision were achieved using eleven sampling points around a skeleton of 0, 2, 7, 14 and 56 days. The standard error of the 'sterilizing' rate constant was reduced more than 4-fold, and sample size for realistic treatment effects was effectively halved. Even schemes with a restricted duration of sampling to avoid high proportions of missing data and those with fewer sampling points still achieved significant gains in precision. Sensitivity analysis suggested that such schemes should continue to perform well over the immediately foreseeable range of improvements in therapy.

DESIGN: A compartmental difference-equation model of TB/HIV was developed using parameter estimates from the literature. METHODS: The impact of five TB control interventions (rapid molecular testing, mycobacterial culture, community-wide and HIV-targeted active case finding, and highly active antiretroviral therapy) on TB incidence, prevalence, and mortality was modeled in a steady-state population with an HIV prevalence of 17% and annual TB incidence of 409 per 100 000. Sensitivity analyses assessed the influence of each model parameter on the interventions' mortality impact. RESULTS: Enhanced diagnostic techniques (rapid molecular testing or culture) are each projected to reduce TB prevalence and mortality by 20% or more, an impact similar to that of active case-finding in 33% of the general community and greater than the effect achievable by case-finding or antiretroviral treatment efforts in HIV-positive patients alone. The projected impact of enhanced diagnostics on TB incidence (< 10% reduction) is smaller. The impact of TB diagnostics is sensitive to the quality of existing diagnostic standards and the level of access to diagnostic services, but is robust across a wide range of population parameters including HIV and TB incidence.

Government health expenditures, patient and family costs were measured in direct surveys in Haiti and expressed in 2003 US$. RESULTS: Starting in 2003, DOTS expansion in Haiti is anticipated to cost $4.2 million and result in 63,080 fewer tuberculosis cases, 53,120 fewer tuberculosis deaths, and net societal savings of $131 million, over 20 years. Current government spending for tuberculosis is high, relative to the per capita income, and would be only slightly lower with DOTS. Societal savings would begin within 4 years, and would be substantial in all scenarios considered, including higher HIV seroprevalence or drug resistance, unchanged incidence following DOTS expansion, or doubling of initial and ongoing costs for DOTS expansion. CONCLUSION: A modest investment for DOTS expansion in Haiti would provide considerable humanitarian benefit by reducing tuberculosis-related morbidity, mortality and costs for patients and their families. These benefits, together with projected minimal Haitian government savings, argue strongly for donor support for DOTS expansion.",6,1471-2458 (Electronic),209,http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/6/209,BMC Public Health

JOUR,article,578,Modelling the human immune response mechanisms to mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in the lungs,2006-01-01,"This work elaborates on the effects of cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTLs) and other immune mechanisms in determining whether a TB-infected individual will develop active or latent TB. It answers one intriguing question: why do individuals infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) experience different clinical outcomes? In addressing this question, we have developed a model that captures the effects of CTLs and the combined effects of CD4+ helper T cells (Th1 and Th2) immune response mechanisms to TB infection. The occurrence of active or latent infection is shown to depend on a number of factors that include effector function and levels of CTLs. We use the model to predict disease progression scenarios, including primary, latency or clearance. Model analysis shows that occurrence of active disease is much attributed to the Mtb pathogen ability to persist outside the intracellular environment and that high levels of CTLs result in latent TB, while low levels of CTLs result in active TB. This is attributed to the CTLs' ability to directly kill infected macrophages and the bacteria inside the infected macrophages. The study suggests directions for further basic studies and potential new treatment strategies.",3,1547-1063 (Print),661-82,NA,Math Biosci Eng

JOUR,article,903,The long-term health and economic benefits of DOTS implementation in Ecuador,2006-01-01,"BACKGROUND: Between April 2001 and March 2004, the Directly Observed Therapy-Short course (DOTS) program was successfully implemented by the National Tuberculosis control program, with assistance from the Canadian Lung Association, in three provinces of Ecuador, where 52% of the population of the country reside. METHODS: Markov modelling was used to project TB-related morbidity, mortality and costs if the former TB control program (status quo) had continued or if the newly expanded DOTS program is maintained over 20 years. Extensive sensitivity analyses were used to determine the effect on projected outcomes of varying key assumptions. RESULTS: If DOTS is maintained over the next 20 years, we predict that 18,760 cases and 15,812 TB-related deaths will be prevented, resulting in societal savings of dollars 203 million and government savings of dollars 7.1 million (all costs in dollars US). These findings were robust in extensive sensitivity analyses. Given the initial investment of dollars 3 million for DOTS implementation, this would mean a cost of dollars 190 per life saved. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of DOTS could yield very substantial public health and economic benefits for Ecuador. These results demonstrate the benefits from Canadian government support for DOTS implementation in low- and middle-income countries.",97,0008-4263 (Print),14-9,NA,Can J Public Health
JOUR,article,911,Cost-effectiveness of tuberculosis evaluation and treatment of newly-arrived immigrants,2006-01-01,"BACKGROUND: Immigrants to the U.S. are required to undergo overseas screening for tuberculosis (TB), but the value of evaluation and treatment following entry to the U.S. is not well understood. We determined the cost-effectiveness of domestic follow-up of immigrants identified as tuberculosis suspects through overseas screening. METHODS: Using a stochastic simulation for tuberculosis reactivation, transmission, and follow-up for a hypothetical cohort of 1000 individuals, we calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness of follow-up and evaluation interventions. We utilized published literature, California Reports of Verified Cases of Tuberculosis (RVCTs), demographic estimates from the California Department of Finance, Medicare reimbursement, and Medi-Cal reimbursement rates. Our target population was legal immigrants to the United States, our time horizon is twenty years, and our perspective was that of all domestic health-care payers. We examined the intervention to offer latent tuberculosis therapy to infected individuals, to increase the yield of domestic evaluation, and to increase the starting and completion rates of LTBI therapy with INH (isoniazid). Our outcome measures were the number of cases averted, the number of deaths averted, the incremental dollar cost (year 2004), and the number of quality-adjusted life-years saved. RESULTS: Domestic follow-up of B-notification patients, including LTBI treatment for latently infected individuals, is highly cost-effective, and at times, cost-saving. B-notification follow-up in California would reduce the number of new tuberculosis cases by about 6-26 per year (out of a total of approximately 3000). Sensitivity analysis revealed that domestic follow-up remains cost-effective when the hepatitis rates due to INH therapy are over fifteen times our best estimates, when at least 0.4 percent of patients have active disease and when hospitalization of cases detected through domestic follow-up is no less likely than hospitalization of passively detected cases. CONCLUSION: While the current immigration screening program is unlikely to result in a large change in case rates, domestic follow-up of B-notification patients, including LTBI treatment, is highly cost-effective. If as many as three percent of screened individuals have active TB, and early detection reduces the rate of hospitalization, net savings may be expected.",6,1471-2458 (Electronic),157,http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/6/157,BMC Public Health
JOUR,article,921,Cost-effectiveness of treating multidrug-resistant tuberculosis,2006-01-01,"BACKGROUND: Despite the existence of effective drug treatments, tuberculosis (TB) causes 2 million deaths annually worldwide. Effective treatment is complicated by multidrug-resistant TB (MDR TB) strains that respond only to second-line drugs. We projected the health benefits and cost-effectiveness of using drug susceptibility testing and second-line drugs in a lower-middle-income setting with high levels of MDR TB. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We developed a dynamic state-transition model of TB. In a base case analysis, the model was calibrated to approximate the TB epidemic in Peru, a setting with a smear-positive TB incidence of 120 per 100,000 and 4.5% MDR TB among prevalent cases. Secondary analyses considered other settings. The following strategies were evaluated: first-line drugs administered under directly observed therapy (DOTS), locally standardized second-line drugs for previously treated cases (STR1), locally standardized second-line drugs for previously treated cases with test-confirmed MDR TB (STR2), comprehensive drug susceptibility testing and individualized treatment for previously treated cases (ITR1), and comprehensive drug susceptibility testing and individualized treatment for all cases (ITR2). Outcomes were costs per TB death averted and costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. We found that strategies incorporating the use of second-line drug regimens following first-line treatment failure were highly cost-effective compared to strategies using first-line drugs only. In our base case, standardized second-line treatment for confirmed MDR TB cases (STR2) had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 720 dollars per QALY (8,700 dollars per averted death) compared to DOTS. Individualized second-line drug treatment for MDR TB following first-line failure (ITR1) provided more benefit at an incremental cost of 990 dollars per QALY (12,000 dollars per averted death) compared to STR2. A more aggressive version of the individualized treatment strategy (ITR2), in which both new and previously treated cases are tested for MDR TB, had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 11,000 dollars per QALY (160,000 dollars per averted death) compared to ITR1. The STR2 and ITR1 strategies remained cost-effective under a wide range of alternative assumptions about treatment costs, effectiveness, MDR TB prevalence, and transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of MDR TB using second-line drugs is highly cost-effective in Peru. In other settings, the attractiveness of strategies using second-line drugs will depend on TB incidence, MDR burden, and the available budget, but simulation results suggest that individualized regimens would be cost-effective in a wide range of situations.",3,1549-1676; 1549-1277,e241,NA,PLoS Med
JOUR,article,934,Prospects for advancing tuberculosis control efforts through novel therapies,2006-01-01,"BACKGROUND: Development of new, effective, and affordable tuberculosis (TB) therapies has been identified as a critical priority for global TB control. As new candidates emerge from the global TB drug pipeline, the potential impacts of novel, shorter regimens on TB incidence and mortality have not yet been examined. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used a mathematical model of TB to evaluate the expected benefits of shortening the duration of effective chemotherapy for active pulmonary TB. First, we considered general relationships between treatment duration and TB dynamics. Next, as a specific example, we calibrated the model to reflect the current situation in the South-East Asia region. We found that even with continued and rapid progress in scaling up the World Health Organization's DOTS strategy of directly observed, short-course chemotherapy, the benefits of reducing treatment duration would be substantial. Compared to a baseline of continuing DOTS coverage at current levels, and with currently available tools, a 2-mo regimen introduced by 2012 could prevent around 20% (range 13%-28%) of new cases and 25% (range 19%-29%) of TB deaths in South-East Asia between 2012 and 2030. If effective treatment with existing drugs expands rapidly, overall incremental benefits of shorter regimens would be lower, but would remain considerable (13% [range 8%-19%] and 19% [range 15%-23%] reductions in incidence and mortality, respectively, between 2012 and 2030). A ten-year delay in the introduction of new drugs would erase nearly three-fourths of the total expected benefits in this region through 2030. CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of new, shorter treatment regimens could dramatically accelerate the reductions in TB incidence and mortality that are expected under current regimens-with up to 2- or 3-fold increases in rates of decline if shorter regimens are accompanied by enhanced case detection. Continued progress in reducing the global TB burden will require a balanced approach to pursuing new technologies while promoting wider implementation of proven strategies.",3,1549-1676 (Electronic),e273,http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/fetchObjectAttachment.action?uri=info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.0030273&representation=PDF,PLoS Med

Early events in infection are particularly important, as are spatial effects and inherently stochastic processes.

JOUR,article,1022,Direct costs of three models for the screening of latent tuberculosis infection,2006-01-01,"The aim of the present study was to compare the direct costs of three models for detection of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in routine clinical practice in Switzerland. Comparison of the overall costs of screening for LTBI, including medical and radiological examination, and preventive treatment associated with three screening models was carried out. Model 1 relies only on the tuberculin skin test (TST) according to the current national guidelines, model 2 relies on T-SPOT.TB (Oxford Immunotec, Oxford, UK) only and model 3 relies on TST followed by confirmation of positive results by T-SPOT.TB. Costs were taken directly from the clinic's figures. Clinical assumptions were based on the 267 patients who were referred to the clinic over the study period. Model 3 was found to be the most cost-effective. Using only the skin test (model 1) was the least cost-effective. If only one test for LTBI is to be used, then model 2 (using T-SPOT.TB only) is cheaper than using the TST (model 1). Screening for latent tuberculosis infection by tuberculin skin test followed by confirmation with T-SPOT.TB is less costly than screening with tuberculin skin test alone, as it allows a reduction in the number of people who receive preventive treatment. In groups with a high proportion of negative tuberculin skin tests, screening with T-SPOT.TB test only may be the most cost-effective.",28,0903-1936; 0903-1936,45-50,NA,The European respiratory journal : official journal of the European Society for Clinical Respiratory Physiology

They consider the effect of varying individual immune response strength on the dynamics for the appearance of resistant bacteria. From the analysis of the models, equilibria and local stabilities are determined. For assessing temporal dynamics and global stability for sensitive and drug-resistant bacteria, numerical simulations are used. Results indicate that for a low bacteria load that is characteristic of latent TB and for small reduction in an immune response, the use of a single drug is capable of curing the infection before the appearance of drug resistance. However, for severe immune deficiency, the use of two drugs will provide a larger time period before the emergence of resistance. Therefore, in this case, two-drugs treatment will be more efficient in controlling the infection.",24,1477-8599 (Print),35-56,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17060491,Math Med Biol

However, little work has been done to determine the optimal level of investment in contact tracing. In this paper, we present a methodology for evaluating the appropriate level of investment in contact tracing. We develop and apply a simulation model of contact tracing and the spread of an infectious disease among a network of individuals in order to evaluate the cost and effectiveness of different levels of contact tracing. We show that contact tracing is likely to have diminishing returns to scale in investment: incremental investments in contact tracing yield diminishing reductions in disease prevalence. In conjunction with a cost-effectiveness threshold, we then determine the optimal amount that should be invested in contact tracing. We first assume that the only incremental disease control is contact tracing. We then extend the analysis to consider the optimal allocation of a budget between contact tracing and screening for exogenous infection, and between contact tracing and screening for endogenous infection. We discuss how a simulation model of this type, appropriately tailored, could be used as a policy tool for determining the appropriate level of investment in contact tracing for a specific disease in a specific population.

Depending on levels of HAART population coverage, increasing MDRTB cure rates from 5% to 80% reduces cumulative tuberculosis deaths by 1% and 13%.

JOUR,article,637,Impact of joined-up HIV harm reduction and multidrug resistant tuberculosis control programmes in Estonia: System dynamics simulation model,2007-01-01,"In Eastern Europe and Central Asia (ECA) the control of tuberculosis, multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDRTB) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) poses important public health challenges. We used system dynamics simulation to determine impact on cumulative HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and HIV-associated-tuberculosis deaths, over 20 years, of harm-reduction programmes to reduce needle-sharing and injection-frequency amongst injecting drug users (IDUs) and multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDRTB) control in a population with an explosive HIV epidemic in IDUs and high MDRTB prevalence. We estimate that the number of HIV-associated-deaths will decline by 30% with effective harm-reduction programmes but double if these are ineffective. In our model, effective MDRTB and HIV control reduces cumulative tuberculosis deaths by 54%, cumulative MDRTB deaths 15-fold and cumulative HIV-associated-tuberculosis-deaths 2-fold. Effective MDRTB control, without effective harm-reduction programmes, only reduce tuberculosis deaths by 22%. However, effective harm-reduction programme with a poor MDRTB control reduce cumulative tuberculosis deaths by 34%, MDRTB by 14% and HIV-associated-tuberculosis by 56%. Even with good control programmes for drug sensitive TB, neglecting harm reduction and MDRTB control will result in 50% more tuberculosis-related deaths than if both are effectively addressed.

We modelled the plausible effect of rapidly available infection control strategies on the overall course of the XDR tuberculosis epidemic in a rural area of South Africa. METHODS: We investigated the effect of administrative, environmental, and personal infection control measures on the epidemic trajectory of XDR tuberculosis in the rural community of Tugela Ferry. Assessments were done with a mathematical model incorporating over 2 years of longitudinal inpatient and community-based data. The model simulated inpatient airborne tuberculosis transmission, community tuberculosis transmission, and the effect of HIV and antiretroviral therapy. FINDINGS: If no new interventions are introduced, about 1300 cases of XDR tuberculosis are predicted to occur in the area of Tugela Ferry by the end of 2012, more than half of which are likely to be nosocomially transmitted. Mask use alone would avert fewer than 10% of cases in the overall epidemic, but could prevent a large proportion of cases of XDR tuberculosis in hospital staff. The combination of mask use with reduced hospitalisation time and a shift to outpatient therapy could prevent nearly a third of XDR tuberculosis cases. Supplementing this approach with improved ventilation, rapid drug resistance testing, HIV treatment, and tuberculosis isolation facilities could avert 48% of XDR tuberculosis cases (range 34-50%) by the end of 2012. However, involuntary detention could result in an unexpected rise in incidence due to restricted isolation capacity. INTERPRETATION: A synergistic combination of available nosocomial infection control strategies could prevent nearly half of XDR tuberculosis cases, even in a resource-limited setting.

JOUR,article,698,Exogenous re-infection and the dynamics of tuberculosis epidemics: local effects in a network model of transmission,2007-01-01,"Infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis leads to tuberculosis (TB) disease by one of the three possible routes: primary progression after a recent infection; re-activation of a latent infection; or exogenous re-infection of a previously infected individual. Recent studies show that optimal TB control strategies may vary depending on the predominant route to disease in a specific population. It is therefore important for public health policy makers to understand the relative frequency of each type of TB within specific epidemiological scenarios. Although molecular epidemiologic tools have been used to estimate the relative contribution of recent transmission and re-activation to the burden of TB disease, it is not possible to use these techniques to distinguish between primary disease and re-infection on a population level. Current estimates of the contribution of re-infection therefore rely on mathematical models which identify the parameters most consistent with epidemiological data; these studies find that exogenous re-infection is important only when TB incidence is high. A basic assumption of these models is that people in a population are all equally likely to come into contact with an infectious case. However, theoretical studies demonstrate that the social and spatial structure can strongly influence the dynamics of infectious disease transmission. Here, we use a network model of TB transmission to evaluate the impact of non-homogeneous mixing on the relative contribution of re-infection over realistic epidemic trajectories. In contrast to the findings of previous models, our results suggest that re-infection may be important in communities where the average disease incidence is moderate or low as the force of infection can be unevenly distributed in the population.

METHODS: The health and economic outcomes of isoniazid treatment of 20-year-old close-contacts were compared in a Markov model over a period of 20 years, using two different cutoff values for the tuberculin skin test (TST), the QFT-G assay alone, or the QFT-G assay as a confirmatory test for the TST results. RESULTS: QFT-G assay-based treatment led to cost savings of $542.9 and 3.8 life-days gained per LTBI case. TST-based treatment at a 10-mm induration size cutoff gained $177.4 and 2.0 life-days gained per test-positive contact. When the cutoff induration size for the TST was reduced to 5 mm, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio fell below the willingness-to-pay threshold ($30,170 per life-years gained) but resulted in unnecessary treatment of 77% of contacts owing to false-positive TST results. Combination with the 5-mm induration size TST cutoff value compared to the results of the QFT-G assay alone reduced the total costs per 1,000 contacts by 1.8% to $222,869. The number treated to prevent 1 TB case was 22 for the two QFT-G assay-based procedures, 40 for the TST at a cutoff induration size of 10 mm, and 96 for the TST at a cutoff induration size of 5 mm. When the sensitivity rates of the TST and the QFT-G assay were compounded, the QFT-G assay strategy alone was slightly less costly (0.6%) than the two-step approach. CONCLUSIONS: Using the QFT-G assay, but especially combining the QFT-G assay following the TST screening of close-contacts at a cutoff induration size of 5 mm before LTBI treatment is highly cost-effective in reducing the disease burden of TB.",131,0012-3692; 0012-3692,1424-1434,NA,Chest

RESULTS: In our base-case scenario, the cost to prevent an additional case of tuberculosis by using targeted testing, compared with no screening, was $524,897. The cost to prevent an additional case by using universal screening, compared with targeted testing, was $671,398. The incremental cost of preventing a case through screening remained above $100,000 unless the prevalence of tuberculin skin testing positivity increased to >10%. More than 51% of children entering kindergarten in California live where tuberculin skin testing is mandatory. CONCLUSIONS: The cost to prevent a case of tuberculosis by using either universal screening or targeted testing of kindergarteners is high. If targeted testing replaced universal tuberculin skin testing in California, then $1.27 million savings per year would be generated for more cost-effective strategies to prevent tuberculosis. Improving the positive predictive value of the risk factor tool or applying it to groups with higher prevalence of latent tuberculosis would make its use more cost-effective. Universal tuberculin skin testing should be discontinued, and targeted testing should be considered only when the prevalence of risk factor positivity and the prevalence of tuberculin skin testing positivity among risk factor-positive individuals are high enough to meet acceptable thresholds for cost-effectiveness.",120,1098-4275 (Electronic),90-9,http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/120/1/90.full.pdf,Pediatrics
JOUR,article,783,Implications of partial immunity on the prospects for tuberculosis control by post-exposure interventions,2007-01-01,"One-third of the world population (approximately 2 billion individuals) is currently infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the vast majority harboring a latent infection. As the risk of reactivation is around 10% in a lifetime, it follows that 200 million of these will eventually develop active pulmonary disease. Only therapeutic or post-exposure interventions can tame this vast reservoir of infection. Treatment of latent infections can reduce the risk of reactivation, and there is accumulating evidence that combination with post-exposure vaccines can reduce the risk of reinfection. Here we develop mathematical models to explore the potential of these post-exposure interventions to control tuberculosis on a global scale. Intensive programs targeting recent infections appear generally effective, but the benefit is potentially greater in intermediate prevalence scenarios. Extending these strategies to longer-term persistent infections appears more beneficial where prevalence is low. Finally, we consider that susceptibility to reinfection is altered by therapy, and explore its epidemiological consequences. When we assume that therapy reduces susceptibility to subsequent reinfection, catastrophic dynamics are observed. Thus, a bipolar outcome is obtained, where either small or large reductions in prevalence levels result, depending on the rate of detection and treatment of latent infections. By contrast, increased susceptibility after therapy may induce an increase in disease prevalence and does not lead to catastrophic dynamics. These potential outcomes are silent unless a widespread intervention is implemented.",248,0022-5193 (Print),608-17,http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0022519307002846/1-s2.0-S0022519307002846-main.pdf?_tid=5839d379ca81b25a7b73afd9055a8d60&acdnat=1345012345_79ffbc04fe99446b4f36cf19900f8c40,J Theor Biol
JOUR,article,793,Isoniazid bactericidal activity and resistance emergence: integrating pharmacodynamics and pharmacogenomics to predict efficacy in different ethnic populations,2007-01-01,"Isoniazid, administered as part of combination antituberculosis therapy, is responsible for most of the early bactericidal activity (EBA) of the regimen. However, the emergence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistance to isoniazid is a major problem. We examined the relationship between isoniazid exposure and M. tuberculosis microbial kill, as well as the emergence of resistance, in our in vitro pharmacodynamic model of tuberculosis. Since single-nucleotide polymorphisms of the N-acetyltransferase-2 gene lead to two different clearances of isoniazid from serum in patients, we simulated the isoniazid concentration-time profiles encountered in both slow and fast acetylators. Both microbial kill and the emergence of resistance during monotherapy were associated with the ratio of the area under the isoniazid concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h (AUC(0-24)) to the isoniazid MIC. The time in mutant selection window hypothesis was rejected. Next, we utilized the in vitro relationship between the isoniazid AUC(0-24)/MIC ratio and microbial kill, the distributions of isoniazid clearance in populations with different percentages of slow and fast acetylators, and the distribution of isoniazid MICs for isonazid-susceptible M. tuberculosis clinical isolates in Monte Carlo simulations to calculate the EBA expected for approximately 10,000 patients treated with 300 mg of isoniazid. For those patient populations in which the proportion of fast acetylators and the isoniazid MICs were high, the average EBA of the standard dose was approximately 0.3 log(10) CFU/ml/day and was thus suboptimal. Our approach, which utilizes preclinical pharmacodynamics and the genetically determined multimodal distributions of serum clearances, is a preclinical tool that may be able to predict the EBAs of various doses of new antituberculosis drugs.",51,0066-4804 (Print),2329-36,http://aac.asm.org/content/51/7/2329.full.pdf,Antimicrob Agents Chemother
BILL,misc,804,Early detection of tuberculosis outbreaks among the San Francisco homeless: trade-offs between spatial resolution and temporal scale,2007-01-01,"BACKGROUND: San Francisco has the highest rate of tuberculosis (TB) in the U.S. with recurrent outbreaks among the homeless and marginally housed. It has been shown for syndromic data that when exact geographic coordinates of individual patients are used as the spatial base for outbreak detection, higher detection rates and accuracy are achieved compared to when data are aggregated into administrative regions such as zip codes and census tracts. We examine the effect of varying the spatial resolution in the TB data within the San Francisco homeless population on detection sensitivity, timeliness, and the amount of historical data needed to achieve better performance measures. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We apply a variation of space-time permutation scan statistic to the TB data in which a patient's location is either represented by its exact coordinates or by the centroid of its census tract. We show that the detection sensitivity and timeliness of the method generally improve when exact locations are used to identify real TB outbreaks. When outbreaks are simulated, while the detection timeliness is consistently improved when exact coordinates are used, the detection sensitivity varies depending on the size of the spatial scanning window and the number of tracts in which cases are simulated. Finally, we show that when exact locations are used, smaller amount of historical data is required for training the model. CONCLUSION: Systematic characterization of the spatio-temporal distribution of TB cases can widely benefit real time surveillance and guide public health investigations of TB outbreaks as to what level of spatial resolution results in improved detection sensitivity and timeliness. Trading higher spatial resolution for better performance is ultimately a tradeoff between maintaining patient confidentiality and improving public health when sharing data. Understanding such tradeoffs is critical to managing the complex interplay between public policy and public health. This study is a step forward in this direction.",2,NA,e1284,http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0001284,PLoS One

METHODS: Randomized controlled trial. Adolescents between the ages of 11 and 19 years who were referred to one of two participating clinics after being screened for TB and receiving a positive diagnosis indicating LTBI (n = 794) were assigned to one of four groups: usual care, peer counseling, contingency contracting, and combined peer counseling/contingency contracting. Primary outcome variables were completion of isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT), total treatment costs, and lifetime TB-related costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) in each of the four study groups (three treatment, one control). Cost effectiveness was evaluated using a five-stage Markov model and a Monte Carlo simulation with 10,000 trials. RESULTS: Average costs were 199 dollars for usual care (UC), 277 dollars for peer counseling (PC), 326 dollars for contingency contracting (CC), and 341 dollars for PC + CC combined. The differences among these groups were all significant at the p = .001 level. Only the PC + CC group improved the rate of IPT completion (83.8%) relative to usual care (75.9%) (p = .051), with an overall incremental CE ratio of 209 dollars per QALY relative to usual care.

METHODS: Ecological spatial study of TB incidence in Olinda, a city in the north-east of Brazil, during the period 1996-2000. Three socio-economic indicators (mean number of inhabitants per household; percentage of heads of household with <1 year's formal education; percentage of heads of households with monthly income lower than the minimum wage) and two transmission-related indicators (number of cases of retreatment; number of households with more than one case during the period under study), all calculated per census tract, were used. We adopted four different full hierarchical Bayesian models to estimate the relative risk of the occurrence of TB via Markov chain Monte Carlo. RESULTS: The best specified model includes all the selected covariates and the spatially structured random effect. The gain in goodness-of-fit statistic when the spatial structure was included confirms the clustered spatial pattern of disease and poverty. In this model, the covariates within the non-zero credibility interval were the number of persons per house, the number of cases of retreatment and the number of households with more than one case (all with relative risk > or = 1.8) in each census tract.

JOUR,article,1273,A threshold value for the time delay to TB diagnosis,2007-01-01,"BACKGROUND: In many communities where TB occurs at high incidence, the major force driving the epidemic is transmission. It is plausible that the typical long delay from the onset of infectious disease to diagnosis and commencement of treatment is almost certainly the major factor contributing to the high rate of transmission. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This study is confined to communities which are epidemiologically relatively isolated and which have low HIV incidence. The consequences of delays to diagnosis are analyzed and the existence of a threshold delay value is demonstrated. It is shown that unless a sufficient number of cases are detected before this threshold, the epidemic will escalate. The method used for the analysis avoids the standard computer integration of systems of differential equations since the intention is to present a line of reasoning that reveals the essential dynamics of an epidemic in an intuitively clear way that is nevertheless quantitatively realistic. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The analysis presented here shows that typical delays to diagnosis present a major obstacle to the control of a TB epidemic. Control can be achieved by optimizing the rapid identification of TB cases together with measures to increase the threshold value. A calculated and aggressive program is therefore necessary in order to bring about a reduction in the prevalence of TB in a community by decreasing the time to diagnosis in all its ramifications. Intervention strategies to increase the threshold value relative to the time to diagnosis and which thereby decrease disease incidence are discussed.",2,1932-6203 (Electronic),e757,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17712405,PLoS One
JOUR,article,619,"Cost-effectiveness analysis of introduction of rapid, alternative methods to identify multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in middle-income countries",2008-01-01,"BACKGROUND: Resistance to commonly used antituberculosis drugs is emerging worldwide. Conventional drug-susceptibility testing (DST) methods are slow and demanding. Alternative, rapid DST methods would permit the early detection of drug resistance and, in turn, arrest tuberculosis transmission. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis of 5 DST methods was performed in the context of a clinical trial that compared rapid with conventional DST methods. The methods under investigation were direct phage-replication assay (FASTPlaque-Response; Biotech), direct amplification and reverse hybridization of the rpoB gene (INNO-LiPA; Innogenetics), indirect colorimetric minimum inhibitory concentration assay (MTT; ICN Biomedicals), and direct proportion method on Lowenstein-Jensen medium. These were compared with the widely used indirect proportion method on Lowenstein-Jensen medium. RESULTS: All alternative DST methods were found to be cost-effective, compared with other health care interventions. DST methods also generate substantial cost savings in settings of high prevalence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Excluding the effects of transmission, the direct proportion method on Lowenstein-Jensen medium was the most cost-effective alternative DST method for patient groups with prevalences of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis of 2%, 5%, 20%, and 50% (cost in US$2004, $94, $36, $8, and $2 per disability-adjusted life year, respectively).

JOUR,article,551,The theoretical influence of immunity between strain groups on the progression of drug-resistant tuberculosis epidemics,2008-01-01,"BACKGROUND: Emerging research suggests that genetically distinct strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis may modulate the immune system differently. This may be of importance in high-burden settings where > or =1 genetic group of M. tuberculosis confers significant morbidity. METHODS: A dynamic mathematical model was constructed to evaluate how different degrees of cross-immunity among M. tuberculosis groups could affect epidemics of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB). RESULTS: Simulated populations with immunogenically distinct TB strain groups experienced a heightened risk of drug-resistant TB, compared with populations without such strain diversity, even when the same rates of case detection and treatment success were achieved. The highest risks of infection were observed in populations in which HIV was prevalent. Drug-resistant strains with very low transmission fitness could still propagate in environments with reduced cross-immunity among different strain groups, even after common targets for case detection and treatment success are reached. CONCLUSIONS: It is possible that the propagation of drug-resistant strains could depend not only on the rate of development of resistance and the fitness of the drug-resistant strains but, also, on the diversity of the strains in the region. The risk of infection with drug-resistant strains could be amplified in locations where there is reduced cross-immunity between originating strain groups.

Using airport flight data that commercial airlines reported to the Official Airline Guide (OAG) in 2000, we have examined the network characteristics of network samples obtained under different selection rules. In addition, we have examined different size samples based on largest flight volume and largest metropolitan populations. We have shown that although the bias in network characteristics increases with the reduction of the sample size, a relatively small number of areas that includes the largest airports, the largest cities, the most-connected cities, and the most central cities is enough to describe the dynamics of the global spread of influenza. The analysis suggests that a relatively small number of cities (around 200 or 300 out of almost 3000) can capture enough network information to adequately describe the global spread of a disease such as influenza.

JOUR,article,712,Making sense of agreement among interferon-gamma release assays and tuberculosis skin testing,2008-01-01,"BACKGROUND: Numerous studies of interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) and tuberculin skin testing (TST) to assess latent tuberculosis infection have been published without a framework to understand the extent to which these two tests should agree. Analyzing the causes of variability in agreement levels is crucial. METHODS: A mathematical model of agreement between dichotomous tests was used to understand variations in the level of agreement between IGRA and TST results. The effect of cut-off point selection on agreement was also explored using the model. Model-based predictions are illustrated using published literature. RESULTS: Analyses of IGRAs and TST that depart from model predictions are an indication that surrogates of prevalence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection may have been improperly measured or analyzed. For fixed prevalence, the extent of agreement between tests depends upon cut-off point selection. Changing cut-off points while holding prevalence constant may lead to increasing, decreasing or even no change in agreement. CONCLUSIONS: Researchers have recognized that experimental error, clinical risk and prevalence of non-tuberculous mycobacteria contribute to study-to-study variability. In the present study, we show that paradoxical findings in certain IGRA studies can be explained by the proposed mathematical model. Re-analysis of existing studies may lead to overlooked hypotheses.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We recorded costs, laboratory results, and dates of initiating TB therapy in a centralized TB culture program for HIV-infected patients in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, constructing a decision-analysis model to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness of TB culture from the perspective of a public-sector TB control program. Of 217 TB suspects presenting between January 2006 and March 2008, 33 (15%) had culture-confirmed active tuberculosis; 23 (70%) were smear-negative. Among smear-negative, culture-positive patients, 6 (26%) began TB therapy before culture results were available, 11 (48%) began TB therapy after culture result availability, and 6 (26%) did not begin TB therapy within 180 days of presentation. The cost per negative culture was US$17.52 (solid media)-$23.50 (liquid media). Per 1,000 TB suspects and compared with smear alone, TB culture with solid media would avert an estimated eight TB deaths (95% simulation interval [SI]: 4, 15) and 37 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) (95% SI: 13, 76), at a cost of $36 (95% SI: $25, $50) per TB suspect or $962 (95% SI: $469, $2642) per DALY averted. Replacing solid media with automated liquid culture would avert one further death (95% SI: -1, 4) and eight DALYs (95% SI: -4, 23) at $2751 per DALY (95% SI: $680, dominated). The cost-effectiveness of TB culture was more sensitive to characteristics of the existing TB diagnostic system than to the accuracy or cost of TB culture.

JOUR,article,567,Cost-effectiveness of novel diagnostic tools for the diagnosis of tuberculosis,2008-01-01,"SETTING: The potential cost-effectiveness of improved diagnostic tests for tuberculosis (TB) in resource-limited settings is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness of a hypothetical new point-of-care TB diagnostic test in South Africa, Brazil and Kenya. DESIGN: Decision-analysis model, adding four diagnostic interventions (sputum smear microscopy, new test, smear plus new test and smear plus TB culture) to a baseline of existing infrastructure without smear. RESULTS: Adding sputum smear was estimated to be more cost-effective (incremental cost per disability-adjusted life year [DALY] of $86 [South Africa], $131 [Brazil], $38 (Kenya]) than a new TB diagnostic with 70% sensitivity, 95% specificity and price of $20 per test ($198 [South Africa], $275 [Brazil], $84 [Kenya]). However, compared to sputum smear, smear plus new test averted 46-49% more DALYs per 1000 TB suspects (321 vs. 215 [South Africa], 243 vs. 166 [Brazil], 790 vs. 531 [Kenya]), at an incremental cost of $170 (Kenya) to $625 (Brazil) per DALY averted. Cost-effectiveness was most sensitive to the specificity and price of the new test, the baseline TB case detection rate and the discount rate. CONCLUSION: Novel diagnostic tests for TB are potentially highly cost-effective. Cost-effectiveness is maximized by high-specificity, low-cost tests deployed to regions with poor infrastructure.",12,1027-3719 (Print),1021-9,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18713499,International Journal of Tuberculosis and Lung Disease
JOUR,article,739,Classification of antituberculosis herbs for remedial purposes by using fuzzy sets,2008-01-01,"Using fuzzy set theory, we created a system, that assesses a herb's usefulness for the treatment of tuberculosis, based on ethnobotanical data. We analysed two systems which contain different amount of inputs. The first system contains four inputs, the second one contains six inputs. We used the Takagi-Sugeno-Kanga model. Mamdani model is poor at representation as it needs more fuzzy rules than that of TSK to model a real world system where accuracy is demanded. It has been employed a fuzzy controller, and a fuzzy model, in successfully solving difficult control and modelling problems in practice. It is implemented in the Fuzzy Logic Toolbox in Matlab. The data for inputs are gathered in the database named SOPAT (selection of plants against tuberculosis), which is part of a project coordinated by the Oxford International Biomedical Centre. In this database there could be up to one million plant species. It would be cumbersome to select a remedy from one (or some) of these species looking at the data base one-by-one.

JOUR,article,745,Eliminating human tuberculosis in the twenty-first century,2008-01-01,"Recognizing that tuberculosis (TB) is still the leading cause of human death from a curable infection, the international health community has set ambitious targets for disease control. One target is to eliminate TB by 2050; that is, to cut the annual incidence of new cases to less than 1 per million population. National TB control programmes are working to eliminate TB mainly by intensifying efforts to find and cure patients with active disease. Here, we use mathematical modelling to show that, while most TB patients can be cured with present drug regimens, the 2050 target is far more likely to be achieved with a combination of diagnostics, drugs and vaccines that can detect and treat both latent infection and active disease. We find that the coupling of control methods is particularly effective because treatments for latent infection and active disease act in synergy. This synergistic effect offers new perspectives on the cost-effectiveness of treating latent TB infection and the impact of possible new TB vaccines. Our results should be a stimulus to those who develop, manufacture and implement new technology for TB control, and to their financial donors.",5,1742-5689 (Print),653-62,http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/5/23/653.full.pdf,J R Soc Interface
JOUR,article,569,The infectiousness of tuberculosis patients coinfected with HIV,2008-01-01,"BACKGROUND: The current understanding of airborne tuberculosis (TB) transmission is based on classic 1950s studies in which guinea pigs were exposed to air from a tuberculosis ward. Recently we recreated this model in Lima, Peru, and in this paper we report the use of molecular fingerprinting to investigate patient infectiousness in the current era of HIV infection and multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB. METHODS AND FINDINGS: All air from a mechanically ventilated negative-pressure HIV-TB ward was exhausted over guinea pigs housed in an airborne transmission study facility on the roof. Animals had monthly tuberculin skin tests, and positive reactors were removed for autopsy and organ culture for M. tuberculosis. Temporal exposure patterns, drug susceptibility testing, and DNA fingerprinting of patient and animal TB strains defined infectious TB patients. Relative patient infectiousness was calculated using the Wells-Riley model of airborne infection. Over 505 study days there were 118 ward admissions of 97 HIV-positive pulmonary TB patients. Of 292 exposed guinea pigs, 144 had evidence of TB disease; a further 30 were tuberculin skin test positive only. There was marked variability in patient infectiousness; only 8.5% of 118 ward admissions by TB patients were shown by DNA fingerprinting to have caused 98% of the 125 characterised cases of secondary animal TB. 90% of TB transmission occurred from inadequately treated MDR TB patients. Three highly infectious MDR TB patients produced 226, 52, and 40 airborne infectious units (quanta) per hour. CONCLUSIONS: A small number of inadequately treated MDR TB patients coinfected with HIV were responsible for almost all TB transmission, and some patients were highly infectious. This result highlights the importance of rapid TB drug-susceptibility testing to allow prompt initiation of effective treatment, and environmental control measures to reduce ongoing TB transmission in crowded health care settings. TB infection control must be prioritized in order to prevent health care facilities from disseminating the drug-resistant TB that they are attempting to treat.",5,1549-1676 (Electronic),e188,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&dopt=Citation&list_uids=18798687,PLoS Med
JOUR,article,790,Mathematical modelling of Mycobacterium tuberculosis VNTR loci estimates a very slow mutation rate for the repeats,2008-01-01,"Minisatellites are highly variable tandem repeats used for over 20 years in humans for DNA fingerprinting. In prokaryotes fingerprinting techniques exploiting VNTR (variable number of tandem repeats) polymorphisms have become widely used recently in bacterial typing. However although many investigations into the mechanisms underlying minisatellite variation in humans have been performed, relatively little is known about the processes that mediate bacterial minisatellite polymorphism. An understanding of this is important since it will influence how the results from VNTR experiments are interpreted. The minisatellites of Mycobacterium tuberculosis are well characterized since they are some of the few polymorphic loci in what is otherwise a very homogeneous organism. Using VNTR results from a well-defined and characterized set of M. tuberculosis strains we show that the repeats at a locus are likely to evolve by stepwise contraction or expansion in the number of repeats. A stochastic continuous-time population mathematical model was developed to simulate the evolution of the repeats. This allowed estimation of the tendency of the repeats to increase or decrease and the rate at which they change. The majority of loci tend to lose rather than gain repeats. All of the loci mutate extremely slowly, with an average rate of 2.3 x 10(-8), which is 350 times slower than that of a set of VNTR repeats with similar diversity observed experimentally in Escherichia coli. This suggests that the VNTR profile of a strain of M. tuberculosis will be indicative of its clonal lineage and will be unlikely to vary in epidemiologically-related strains.",66,0022-2844 (Print),565-74,http://www.springerlink.com/content/j2j4v867632868gu/,J Mol Evol

JOUR,article,794,Existence of multiple-stable equilibria for a multi-drug-resistant model of Mycobacterium tuberculosis,2008-01-01,"The resurgence of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis in some parts of Europe and North America calls for a mathematical study to assess the impact of the emergence and spread of such strain on the global effort to effectively control the burden of tuberculosis. This paper presents a deterministic compartmental model for the transmission dynamics of two strains of tuberculosis, a drug-sensitive (wild) one and a multi-drug-resistant strain. The model allows for the assessment of the treatment of people infected with the wild strain. The qualitative analysis of the model reveals the following. The model has a disease-free equilibrium, which is locally asymptotically stable if a certain threshold, known as the effective reproduction number, is less than unity. Further, the model undergoes a backward bifurcation, where the disease-free equilibrium coexists with a stable endemic equilibrium. One of the main novelties of this study is the numerical illustration of tri-stable equilibria, where the disease-free equilibrium coexists with two stable endemic equilibrium when the aforementioned threshold is less than unity, and a bi-stable setup, involving two stable endemic equilibria, when the effective reproduction number is greater than one. This, to our knowledge, is the first time such dynamical features have been observed in TB dynamics. Finally, it is shown that the backward bifurcation phenomenon in this model arises due to the exogenous re-infection property of tuberculosis.",5,1547-1063 (Print),437-55,NA,Math Biosci Eng

For the basic model, we present new analysis on the existence and stability of equilibria. Then, we use numerical simulations of the model to illustrate the behavior of the system. We apply the model to Canadian reported data on tuberculosis and observe a good agreement between the model prediction and the data. For the extended model, which incorporated the recruitment of the latent and infectious in immigrants to the basic model, we find that the usual threshold condition does not apply and a unique equilibrium exists for all parameter values. This indicates that the disease does not disappear and becomes endemic in host areas. This finding is also supported by numerical simulations with the extended model.

JOUR,article,830,Cost effectiveness of interferon-gamma release assay for tuberculosis contact screening in Japan,2008-01-01,"BACKGROUND: Nearly the entire population of Japan has been vaccinated with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), which causes a false-positive result in the tuberculin skin test (TST). The interferon-gamma release assay QuantiFERON-TB Gold (QFT) is a new alternative to the TST that can be used to screen for latent tuberculosis infection and active tuberculosis, as it has no cross-reactivity with BCG. METHODS: We constructed a Markov model to evaluate the cost effectiveness of the QFT for tuberculosis contact screening. The target population is a hypothetical cohort of 1000 immunocompetent 20-year-old individuals who have had contact with sputum-smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis patients. The analysis was conducted from a societal perspective over the lifetime of a contact. We compared the QFT-alone strategy with the TST followed by QFT (TST/QFT) strategy and the TST-alone strategy. RESULTS: In a base-case analysis, the QFT-alone strategy was dominant ($US 471.54; 28.1099 quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]), compared with the TST/QFT strategy ($US 500.55; 28.1087 QALYs) and the TST-alone strategy ($US573.98; 28.1079 QALYs). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the QFT-alone strategy was a cost saving of $US23 043.5/QALY gained compared with the TST/QFT strategy. On one-way sensitivity analysis, TST specificity and the prevalence of tuberculosis/latent tuberculosis infection affected the cost effectiveness. The probabilistic analysis showed that the QFT-alone strategy has a 95% chance of being cost effective at a threshold ratio of $US2.10/QALY gained, compared with the TST/QFT strategy. CONCLUSION: The QFT-alone strategy is the most cost effective for tuberculosis contact screening in Japan.",12,1177-1062 (Print),235-51,NA,Mol Diagn Ther
JOUR,article,836,Modeling the impact of tuberculosis control strategies in highly endemic overcrowded prisons,2008-01-01,"BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) in prisons is a major health problem in countries of high and intermediate TB endemicity such as Brazil. For operational reasons, TB control strategies in prisons cannot be compared through population based intervention studies. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A mathematical model is proposed to simulate the TB dynamics in prison and evaluate the potential impact on active TB prevalence of several intervention strategies. The TB dynamics with the ongoing program was simulated over a 10 year period in a Rio de Janeiro prison (TB prevalence 4.6 %). Then, a simulation of the DOTS strategy reaching the objective of 70 % of bacteriologically-positive cases detected and 85 % of detected cases cured was performed; this strategy reduced only to 2.8% the average predicted TB prevalence after 5 years. Adding TB detection at entry point to DOTS strategy had no major effect on the predicted active TB prevalence. But, adding further a yearly X-ray mass screening of inmates reduced the predicted active TB prevalence below 1%. Furthermore, according to this model, after applying this strategy during 2 years (three annual screenings), the TB burden would be reduced and the active TB prevalence could be kept at a low level by associating X-ray screening at entry point and DOTS. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We have shown that X-ray mass screenings should be considered to control TB in highly endemic prison. Prisons with different levels of TB prevalence could be examined thanks to this model which provides a rational tool for public health deciders.",3,1932-6203 (Electronic),e2100,http://www.plosone.org/article/fetchObjectAttachment.action?uri=info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0002100&representation=PDF,PLoS One

We aimed to predict the effects of risk-factor trends on COPD, lung cancer, and tuberculosis. METHODS: We used representative data sources to estimate past trends in smoking and household solid-fuel use and to construct a range of future scenarios. We obtained the aetiological effects of risk factors on diseases from meta-analyses of epidemiological studies and from large studies in China. We modelled future COPD and lung cancer mortality and tuberculosis incidence, taking into account the accumulation of hazardous effects of risk factors on COPD and lung cancer over time, and dependency of the risk of tuberculosis infection on the prevalence of disease. We quantified the sensitivity of our results to methods and data choices. FINDINGS: If smoking and solid-fuel use remain at current levels between 2003 and 2033, 65 million deaths from COPD and 18 million deaths from lung cancer are predicted in China; 82% of COPD deaths and 75% of lung cancer deaths will be attributable to the combined effects of smoking and solid-fuel use. Complete gradual cessation of smoking and solid-fuel use by 2033 could avoid 26 million deaths from COPD and 6.3 million deaths from lung cancer; interventions of intermediate magnitude would reduce deaths by 6-31% (COPD) and 8-26% (lung cancer). Complete cessation of smoking and solid-fuel use by 2033 would reduce the projected annual tuberculosis incidence in 2033 by 14-52% if 80% DOTS coverage is sustained, 27-62% if 50% coverage is sustained, or 33-71% if 20% coverage is sustained.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of Quanti-FERON-TB Gold (QFT-G) vs. the tuberculin skin test (TST) in diagnosing LTBI in contacts of active TB cases using a decision analytic Markov model. METHODS: Three screening strategies--TST alone, QFT-G alone and sequential screening of TST then QFT-G--were evaluated. The model was further stratified according to ethnicity and bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination status. Data sources included published studies and empirical data. Results were reported in terms of the incremental net monetary benefit (INMB) of each strategy compared with the baseline strategy of TST-based screening in all contacts. RESULTS: The most economically attractive strategy was to administer QFT-G in BCG-vaccinated contacts, and to reserve TST for all others (INMB CA$3.70/contact). The least cost-effective strategy was QFT-G for all contacts, which resulted in an INMB of CA$-11.50 per contact. Assuming a higher prevalence of recent infection, faster conversion of QFT-G, a higher rate of TB reactivation, reduction in utility or greater adherence to preventive treatment resulted in QFT-G becoming cost-effective in more subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: Selected use of QFT-G appears to be cost-effective if used in a targeted fashion.",12,1027-3719; 1027-3719,1414-1424,NA,International Journal of Tuberculosis and Lung Disease
JOUR,article,586,The effect of diagnostic delays on the drop-out rate and the total delay to diagnosis of tuberculosis,2008-01-01,"BACKGROUND: Numerous patient and healthcare system-related delays contribute to the overall delay experienced by patients from onset of TB symptoms to diagnosis and treatment. Such delays are critical as infected individuals remain untreated in the community, providing more opportunities for transmission of the disease and adversely affecting the epidemic. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We present an analysis of the factors that contribute to the overall delay in TB diagnosis and treatment, in a resource-poor setting. Impact on the distribution of diagnostic delay times was assessed for various factors, the sensitivity of the diagnostic method being found to be the most significant. A linear relationship was found between the sensitivity of the test and the predicted mean delay time, with an increase in test sensitivity resulting in a reduced mean delay time and a reduction in the drop-out rate. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The results show that in a developing country a number of delay factors, particularly the low sensitivity of the initial sputum smear microscopy test, potentially increase total diagnostic delay times experienced by TB patients significantly.

OBJECTIVES: To examine the cost and cost-effectiveness at the Zambian National TB Reference Laboratory of homemade and commercially produced Lowenstein-Jensen culture (HLJ and CLJ) as well as automated and manually read liquid culture (AMGIT and MMGIT). DESIGN: Costs were estimated from the provider's perspective and based on the average monthly throughput. Cost-effectiveness estimates were based on yield during the study period. RESULTS: All techniques show comparable costs per culture (between US$28 and $32). Costs per Mycobacterium tuberculosis specimen detected were respectively US$197, $202, $312 and $340 for MMGIT, AMGIT, CLJ and HLJ. When modelled for the maximum throughput, costs were above US$95 per M. tuberculosis specimen detected for all techniques. When only performed among smear-negative specimens, costs per additionally identified M. tuberculosis would be US$487 for MMGIT and higher for other methods. CONCLUSION: Based on cost-effectiveness grounds, liquid media compare well with conventional solid media, especially where yield of MGIT is substantially higher than that of LJ media.

The model development and validation involved exploring six different training sets and 15 fingerprint types which resulted in a total of 90 models, with active compounds defined as those with MIC < 5 microM. The best model was derived using Extended Class Fingerprints of maximum diameter 12 (ECFP_12) and a few global descriptors on a training set derived using Functional Class Fingerprints of maximum diameter 4 (FCFP_4). This model demonstrated very good discriminant ability in general, with excellent discriminant statistics for the training set (total accuracy: 0.968; positive recall: 0.967) and a good predictive ability for the test set (total accuracy: 0.869; positive recall: 0.789). The good predictive ability was maintained when the model was applied to a well-separated test set of 2880 compounds derived from a commercial database (total accuracy: 0.73; positive recall: 0.72).

JOUR,article,597,Impact of HIV on novel therapies for tuberculosis control,2008-01-01,"OBJECTIVE AND DESIGN: The increased risk for tuberculosis in HIV-infected people has fueled a worldwide resurgence of tuberculosis. A major hindrance to controlling tuberculosis is the long treatment duration, leading to default, jeopardizing cure, and generating drug resistance. We investigated how tuberculosis is impacted by reducing treatment duration alone or combined with enhanced case detection and/or cure under different HIV prevalence levels. METHODS: Our model includes HIV stages I-IV and was calibrated to long-term tuberculosis and HIV data from Kenya. Benefits were assessed in terms of absolute and relative reductions in new tuberculosis cases and deaths. RESULTS: Compared with present-day strategies, at 3-20% HIV prevalence we attain a 6-20% decrease in incidence and mortality in 25 years when reducing treatment duration alone; benefits exceed 300% when combined with increased detection and cure. Benefits vary substantially according to HIV status and prevalence. Challenges arise because in absolute terms the number of infected people and deaths increases dramatically with increasing HIV prevalence, and because the relative efficacy of tuberculosis control policies displays a nonlinear pattern whereby they become less effective on a per capita basis at HIV prevalence levels greater than 15%. Benefits of reducing treatment duration may even be reversed at extreme HIV prevalence levels. Benefits of increasing cure versus detection increase as HIV prevalence increases. CONCLUSION: Reducing tuberculosis treatment duration, alone or in combination with other control strategies, can provide enormous benefits at high HIV prevalence. Tuberculosis control policies need to account for HIV levels because the efficacy of different interventions varies substantially with HIV prevalence.",22,1473-5571 (Electronic),963-72,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18453856,AIDS
JOUR,article,950,Bayesian modelling of tuberculosis clustering from DNA fingerprint data,2008-01-01,"A combination of continuous and categorical tests, none of which is a gold standard, is often available for classification of subject status in epidemiologic studies. For example, tuberculosis (TB) molecular epidemiology uses select mycobacterial DNA sequences to provide clues about which cases of active TB are likely clustered, implying recent transmission between these cases, versus reactivation of previously acquired infection. The proportion of recently transmitted cases is important to public health, as different control methods are implemented as transmission rates increase. Standard typing methods include IS6110 restriction fragment length polymorphism (IS6110 RFLP), but recently developed polymerase chain reaction based genotyping modalities, including mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit-variable-number tandem repeat and spoligotyping provide quicker results. In addition, it has recently been suggested that results from IS6110 RFLP can be used to create a continuous measure of genetic relatedness, called the nearest genetic distance. Whichever method is used, estimation of cluster rates is rendered difficult by the lack of a gold standard method for classifying cases as clustered or not. Since many of these methods are relatively new, their properties have not been extensively investigated. Misclassification errors subsequently lead to sub-optimal estimation of risk factors for clustering. Here we show how Bayesian latent class models can be used in such situations, for example to simultaneously analyse Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA data from all three of the above methods. Using the data collected at the Public Health Unit in Montreal, we estimate the proportion of clustered cases and the operating characteristics of each method using information from all three methods combined, including both continuous and dichotomous measures from IS6110 RFLP. A misclassification-adjusted regression model provides estimates of the effects of risk factors on the clustering probabilities. We also discuss how one must carefully interpret any inferences that arise from a combination of continuous and dichotomous tests.",27,0277-6715 (Print),140-56,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ez.lshtm.ac.uk/store/10.1002/sim.2899/asset/2899_ftp.pdf?v=1&t=h5w29req&s=302abd98afe554aacc48977400af05ce6136728f,Stat Med
JOUR,article,602,Mathematical analysis of the transmission dynamics of HIV/TB coinfection in the presence of treatment,2008-01-01,"This paper addresses the synergistic interaction between HIV and mycobacterium tuberculosis using a deterministic model, which incorporates many of the essential biological and epidemiological features of the two dis- eases. In the absence of TB infection, the model (HIV-only model) is shown to have a globally asymptotically stable, disease-free equilibrium whenever the associated reproduction number is less than unity and has a unique endemic equilibrium whenever this number exceeds unity. On the other hand, the model with TB alone (TB-only model) undergoes the phenomenon of back- ward bifurcation, where the stable disease-free equilibrium co-exists with a stable endemic equilibrium when the associated reproduction threshold is less than unity. The analysis of the respective reproduction thresholds shows that the use of a targeted HIV treatment (using anti-retroviral drugs) strategy can lead to effective control of HIV provided it reduces the relative infectiousness of individuals treated (in comparison to untreated HIV-infected individuals) below a certain threshold. The full model, with both HIV and TB, is simulated to evaluate the impact of the various treatment strategies. It is shown that the HIV-only treatment strategy saves more cases of the mixed infection than the TB-only strategy. Further, for low treatment rates, the mixed-only strategy saves the least number of cases (of HIV, TB, and the mixed infection) in comparison to the other strategies. Thus, this study shows that if resources are limited, then targeting such resources to treating one of the diseases is more beneficial in reducing new cases of the mixed infection than targeting the mixed infection only diseases. Finally, the universal strategy saves more cases of the mixed infection than any of the other strategies.",5,1547-1063 (Print),145-74,NA,Math Biosci Eng
JOUR,article,978,Tuberculosis screening of travelers to higher-incidence countries: a cost-effectiveness analysis,2008-01-01,"BACKGROUND: Travelers to countries with high tuberculosis incidence can acquire infection during travel. We sought to compare four screening interventions for travelers from low-incidence countries, who visit countries with varying tuberculosis incidence. METHODS: Decision analysis model: We considered hypothetical cohorts of 1,000 travelers, 21 years old, visiting Mexico, the Dominican Republic, or Haiti for three months. Travelers departed from and returned to the United States or Canada; they were born in the United States, Canada, or the destination countries. The time horizon was 20 years, with 3% annual discounting of future costs and outcomes. The analysis was conducted from the health care system perspective. Screening involved tuberculin skin testing (post-travel in three strategies, with baseline pre-travel tests in two), or chest radiography post-travel (one strategy). Returning travelers with tuberculin conversion (one strategy) or other evidence of latent tuberculosis (three strategies) were offered treatment. The main outcome was cost (in 2005 US dollars) per tuberculosis case prevented. RESULTS: For all travelers, a single post-trip tuberculin test was most cost-effective. The associated cost estimate per case prevented ranged from $21,406 for Haitian-born travelers to Haiti, to $161,196 for US-born travelers to Mexico. In all sensitivity analyses, the single post-trip tuberculin test remained most cost-effective. For US-born travelers to Haiti, this strategy was associated with cost savings for trips over 22 months. Screening was more cost-effective with increasing trip duration and infection risk, and less so with poorer treatment adherence. CONCLUSION: A single post-trip tuberculin skin test was the most cost-effective strategy considered, for travelers from the United States or Canada. The analysis did not evaluate the use of interferon-gamma release assays, which would be most relevant for travelers who received BCG vaccination after infancy, as in many European countries.

METHODS: A 6-year Markov decision analytic model simulating the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), number of active TB cases prevented, and costs for hypothetical cohorts of Canadian TB contacts defined by TST size, age group (< 10 y/o or above), ethnicity, closeness of contact, and Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination status. RESULTS: For the majority of subgroups, the current policy of preventive therapy in those with positive TST was the most cost-effective. Nevertheless, our analysis determined that LTBI treatment is not cost-effective in nonhousehold Canadian-born (nonaboriginal) or foreign-born contacts age > or = 10 y/o. On the other hand, empirical treatment without screening of all non-BCG-vaccinated household contacts age < 10 y/o appeared cost-effective. Such an optimal approach would result in an incremental net monetary benefit of $25 for each contact investigated for a willingness-to-pay of $50,000/QALY. Results were robust to several alternative assumptions considered in sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: The current practice of LTBI treatment for TB contacts with a TST size > or = 5 mm is cost-effective. A customized approach based on excluding low risk groups from screening and providing treatment to high risk contacts without screening could improve the performance of the program.",11,1524-4733 (Electronic),842-52,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00334.x/asset/j.1524-4733.2008.00334.x.pdf?v=1&t=h6gegr4a&s=6e1abd0fd1fb12eaef44bdb058379457bdea0270,Value Health
JOUR,article,993,Limited impact of tuberculosis control in Hong Kong: attributable to high risks of reactivation disease,2008-01-01,"Over 50% of the global burden of tuberculosis occurs in South East Asia and the Western Pacific. Since 1950, notification rates in high-income countries in these settings have declined slowly and have remained over ten-fold greater than those in Western populations. The reasons for the slow decline are poorly understood. Using an age-structured model describing the incidence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and disease applied to notification data from Hong Kong, we illustrate that in Hong Kong, a high prevalence of M. tuberculosis infection among older individuals and a high risk of disease through reactivation (e.g. up to 17-fold greater than that estimated for infected males in the United Kingdom) may explain this slow decline. If this feature of the epidemiology of tuberculosis is widespread, the WHO directly observed treatment short-course (DOTS) strategy may have a smaller impact in Asia in the short term than has been implied by recent predictions, all of which have been based on disease risk estimates derived from Western Europe. As a result, it may be difficult to meet the targets for tuberculosis control, which have been prescribed by the UN Millennium Development Goals.",136,0950-2688 (Print),943-52,http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=1872696,Epidemiol Infect
JOUR,article,1010,Mathematical modeling of the cause of tuberculosis during tumor necrosis factor blockade,2008-01-01,"OBJECTIVE: Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockade increases the risk of tuberculosis (TB). The purpose of this study was to use Markov modeling to examine the contributions of reactivation of latent tuberculous infection (LTBI) and the progression of new infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis to active TB due to TNF blockade. These 2 pathogenic mechanisms cannot otherwise be readily distinguished. METHODS: Monte Carlo simulation was used to represent the range of reported values for the incidence of TB associated with infliximab (TNF monoclonal antibody) and etanercept (soluble TNF receptor) therapy. Iterative methods were then used to identify for each pair of incidence rates the Markov model parameters that most accurately represented the distribution of time to onset of TB as reported to the Food and Drug Administration. RESULTS: Modeling revealed an apparent median monthly rate of reactivation of LTBI by infliximab treatment of 20.8%, which was 12.1 times that with etanercept treatment (P<0.001). In contrast, both drugs appeared to pose a high risk of progression of new M tuberculosis infection to active TB. Progression of new infection appeared to cause nearly half of the etanercept-associated cases; it became the predominant cause of infliximab-associated cases only after the first year. CONCLUSION: Despite sharing a common therapeutic target, infliximab and etanercept differ markedly in the rates at which they reactivate LTBI. Confirmation of these findings will require the application of molecular epidemiologic tools to studies of TB in future biologics registries. Hidden Markov modeling and Monte Carlo simulation are powerful tools for revealing otherwise hidden aspects of the pathogenesis of TB.",58,0004-3591 (Print),947-52,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1002/art.23285/asset/23285_ftp.pdf?v=1&t=h5w2ch1j&s=5239a0816f96e987fece13b26966f1ff1563b8ac,Arthritis Rheum

Three datasets containing 2,913 rifampin plasma concentration-time data points, collected from 261 South African pulmonary tuberculosis patients aged 18 to 72 years and weighing 28.5 to 85.5 kg and receiving regular daily treatment that included administration of rifampin (450 to 600 mg) for at least 10 days, were pooled. A compartmental pharmacokinetic model was developed using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling. Variability in the shape of the absorption curve was described using a flexible transit compartment model, in which a delay in the onset of absorption and a gradually changing absorption rate were modeled as the passage of drug through a chain of hypothetical compartments, ultimately reaching the absorption compartment. A previously described implementation was extended to allow its application to multiple-dosing data. The typical population estimate of oral clearance was 19.2 liters x h(-1), while the volume of distribution was estimated to be 53.2 liters. Interindividual variability was estimated to be 52.8% for clearance and 43.4% for volume of distribution. Interoccasional variability was estimated for CL/F (22.5%) and mean transit time during absorption (67.9%). The use of single-drug formulations was found to increase both the mean transit time (by 104%) and clearance (by 23.6%) relative to fixed-dose-combination use. A strong correlation between clearance and volume of distribution suggested substantial variability in bioavailability, which could have clinical implications, given the dependence of treatment effectiveness on exposure. The final model successfully described rifampin pharmacokinetics in the population studied and is suitable for simulation in this context.",52,1098-6596 (Electronic),2138-48,http://aac.asm.org/content/52/6/2138.full.pdf,Antimicrob Agents Chemother

Neonatal vaccination with the portfolio vaccine decreases TB incidence by 39% to 52% by 2050. Drug regimens that shorten treatment duration and are efficacious against drug-resistant strains reduce incidence by 10-27%. New diagnostics reduce incidence by 13-42%.

New vaccines and drug regimens targeted at the vast reservoir of latently infected people, not in the portfolio, would reduce incidence by 37% and 82%, respectively. The combination of preventive latent therapy and a 2-month drug treatment regimen reduces incidence by 94%.

JOUR,article,620,How to optimize tuberculosis case finding: explorations for Indonesia with a health system model,2009-01-01,"BACKGROUND: A mathematical model was designed to explore the impact of three strategies for better tuberculosis case finding. Strategies included: (1) reducing the number of tuberculosis patients who do not seek care; (2) reducing diagnostic delay; and (3) engaging non-DOTS providers in the referral of tuberculosis suspects to DOTS services in the Indonesian health system context. The impact of these strategies on tuberculosis mortality and treatment outcome was estimated using a mathematical model of the Indonesian health system. METHODS: The model consists of multiple compartments representing logical movement of a respiratory symptomatic (tuberculosis suspect) through the health system, including patient- and health system delays. Main outputs of the model are tuberculosis death rate and treatment outcome (i.e. full or partial cure). We quantified the model parameters for the Jogjakarta province context, using a two round Delphi survey with five Indonesian tuberculosis experts. RESULTS: The model validation shows that four critical model outputs (average duration of symptom onset to treatment, detection rate, cure rate, and death rate) were reasonably close to existing available data, erring towards more optimistic outcomes than are actually reported. The model predicted that an intervention to reduce the proportion of tuberculosis patients who never seek care would have the biggest impact on tuberculosis death prevention, while an intervention resulting in more referrals of tuberculosis suspects to DOTS facilities would yield higher cure rates. This finding is similar for situations where the alternative sector is a more important health resource, such as in most other parts of Indonesia. CONCLUSION: We used mathematical modeling to explore the impact of Indonesian health system interventions on tuberculosis treatment outcome and deaths. Because detailed data were not available regarding the current Indonesian population, we relied on expert opinion to quantify the parameters. The fact that the model output showed similar results to epidemiological data suggests that the experts had an accurate understanding of this subject, thereby reassuring the quality of our predictions. The model highlighted the potential effectiveness of active case finding of tuberculosis patients with limited access to DOTS facilities in the developing country setting.",9,1471-2334 (Electronic),87,http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/9/87,BMC Infect Dis
JOUR,article,624,Targeted BCG vaccination against severe tuberculosis in low-prevalence settings: epidemiologic and economic assessment,2009-01-01,"BACKGROUND: BCG vaccine protects against the severe forms of tuberculosis (TB) in children. Several low-prevalence countries are reviewing their policy, usually shifting from universal vaccination to vaccination of infants in high-risk groups only. We combined an epidemiologic analysis with a cost-effectiveness analysis to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of targeted strategies. METHODS: We fitted a static model to the data to estimate vaccine efficacy and risk of disease. We applied our method to the Dutch situation, analyzing severe TB cases in high-risk group children age 0-5, between 1996 and 2003. We considered the current strategy targeting immigrant children from high-incidence countries, and a proposed strategy additionally targeting children from 3 lower-incidence, but higher-immigration, countries. RESULTS: In the absence of vaccination, the annual risk of developing severe TB for a child in the current target group is 3/100,000, while BCG vaccination reduces this risk by 73%. Therefore about 9000 children would need to be vaccinated to prevent 1 case. Vaccinating children from high-incidence countries would then cost about Euro 4,500 per discounted disability-adjusted life year averted. In the extended target group, the risk of disease is somewhat lower with a similar vaccine effectiveness, so costs are raised. CONCLUSIONS: The current Dutch BCG strategy, as well as the proposed inclusion of immigrant children from Turkey, Surinam and former Yugoslavia, is on average cost-effective. However, the low number of both vaccinated and unvaccinated severe TB cases leads to broad confidence intervals on vaccine efficacy, highlighting the difficulty associated with decision-making in low-prevalence settings.",20,1531-5487 (Electronic) 1044-3983 (Linking),562-568,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&dopt=Citation&list_uids=19295437,Epidemiology

We present an evolutionary invasion analysis of tuberculosis that characterizes the direction of tuberculosis evolution in the context of different natural and human-driven selective pressures, including changes in tuberculosis treatment and HIV prevalence. We find that the evolution of tuberculosis virulence can be affected by treatment success rates, the relative transmissibility of emerging strains, the rate of reactivation from latency among hosts, and the life expectancy of hosts.

OBJECTIVE/DESIGN: We used a mathematical model to simulate the benefits and risks of preventive treatment delivered through antiretroviral (ARV) clinics using clinical data from Botswana. RESULTS: Preventive treatment was found to reduce the incidence of tuberculosis (TB) by at least 12 cases per 100000 population per year versus the scenario without such treatment over a 50-year simulation. Isoniazid (INH) resistant TB was observed to increase by <1% per year, even when using pessimistic assumptions about resistance emergence. The use of tuberculin skin testing had little impact as a screening procedure, while secondary treatment was observed to nearly double the impact of a preventive treatment program. Regardless of whether or not preventive treatment was implemented, INH-resistant TB rose in the context of increasing HIV prevalence, but was minimally amplified by preventive treatment itself. CONCLUSIONS: IPT programs implemented through ARV clinics may be effective at reducing TB incidence.

JOUR,article,656,A two strain tuberculosis transmission model with therapy and quarantine,2009-01-01,"Abstract A two strain tuberculosis model with treatment which allows TB patients with the drug sensitive of strain Mycobacterium tuberculosis to be cured is presented. The model is further extended to incorporate quarantine for active TB cases with multi?drug resistant TB strains. The model assumes that latently infected individuals develop active disease as a result of endogenous activation and exogenous reinfection. Qualitative analysis of the model including positivity, boundedness and persistence of solutions are presented. The thresholds and equilibria quantities for the models are determined and stability of the solution is analyzed. From the study we conclude that quarantine of the multi?drug resistant tuberculosis cases reduces the multi?drug resistant tuberculosis induced reproduction number to values below unit, thus this intervention strategy can control the development of multi?drug resistant tuberculosis epidemic.

JOUR,article,704,Interpreting expression data with metabolic flux models: predicting Mycobacterium tuberculosis mycolic acid production,2009-01-01,"Metabolism is central to cell physiology, and metabolic disturbances play a role in numerous disease states. Despite its importance, the ability to study metabolism at a global scale using genomic technologies is limited. In principle, complete genome sequences describe the range of metabolic reactions that are possible for an organism, but cannot quantitatively describe the behaviour of these reactions. We present a novel method for modeling metabolic states using whole cell measurements of gene expression. Our method, which we call E-Flux (as a combination of flux and expression), extends the technique of Flux Balance Analysis by modeling maximum flux constraints as a function of measured gene expression. In contrast to previous methods for metabolically interpreting gene expression data, E-Flux utilizes a model of the underlying metabolic network to directly predict changes in metabolic flux capacity. We applied E-Flux to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacterium that causes tuberculosis (TB). Key components of mycobacterial cell walls are mycolic acids which are targets for several first-line TB drugs. We used E-Flux to predict the impact of 75 different drugs, drug combinations, and nutrient conditions on mycolic acid biosynthesis capacity in M. tuberculosis, using a public compendium of over 400 expression arrays. We tested our method using a model of mycolic acid biosynthesis as well as on a genome-scale model of M. tuberculosis metabolism. Our method correctly predicts seven of the eight known fatty acid inhibitors in this compendium and makes accurate predictions regarding the specificity of these compounds for fatty acid biosynthesis. Our method also predicts a number of additional potential modulators of TB mycolic acid biosynthesis.

Coinfection of a host by more than one pathogen strain may affect the relative frequency of these strains at the population level through complex within- and between-host interactions; in infectious diseases that have a long latent period, interstrain competition during latency is likely to play an important role in disease dynamics. We show that SEIR models that include a class of latently coinfected individuals can have markedly different long-term dynamics than models without coinfection, and that coinfection can greatly facilitate the stable coexistence of strains. We demonstrate these dynamics using a model relevant to tuberculosis in which people may experience latent coinfection with both drug sensitive and drug resistant strains.

JOUR,article,719,Cost-effectiveness of interferon gamma release assays vs tuberculin skin tests in health care workers,2009-01-01,"BACKGROUND: Interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs) offer alternatives to tuberculin skin tests (TSTs) for diagnosing latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). Unlike TSTs, IGRAs require only a single patient visit and are not affected by prior BCG vaccination, providing greater specificity. Of 2 Food and Drug Administration-approved IGRAs, the newer QuantiFERON-TB Gold in Tube test (QFT-GIT) requires less manual processing time than the QuantiFERON-TB Gold test (QFT-G). We compared the cost-effectiveness of the QFT-G, QFT-GIT, and TST for detecting LTBI in new health care workers (HCWs). METHODS: A Markov state-transition decision analytic model using the societal perspective and lifetime horizon was constructed to compare costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) associated with the 3 strategies for hypothetical 35-year-old HCWs with or without prior BCG vaccination. Direct and indirect costs and probabilities were based on manufacturer data, national Veterans Health Administration records, and the published literature. Future costs and QALYs were discounted at 3% per year. RESULTS: Both IGRAs were more effective and less costly than the TST, whether or not the HCW had been vaccinated with BCG previously. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the QFT-G compared with the QFT-GIT was $14,092/QALY for non-BCG-vaccinated HCWs and $103,047/QALY for BCG-vaccinated HCWs. There was no prevalence of LTBI at which the TST became the most effective or least costly strategy. If the sensitivity of the QFT-GIT exceeds that of the QFT-G, then the QFT-GIT is the most effective and least costly strategy. CONCLUSION: Use of the QFT-G and QFT-GIT leads to superior clinical outcomes and lower costs than the TST and should be considered in screening non-BCG-vaccinated and BCG-vaccinated new HCWs for LTBI.",169,1538-3679; 0003-9926,179-187,http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=414724,Archives of Internal Medicine
JOUR,article,726,Enhanced cost-benefit analysis of strategies for LTBI screening and INH chemoprevention in Germany,2009-01-01,"OBJECTIVES: There is only limited economic data in head-to head comparison between a whole blood QuantiFERON TB Gold in tube (QFT) and the tuberculin skin test (TST) when screening and treating for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), and no published study to date that takes into account the predictive value of the two tests. METHODS: Health and economic outcomes of isoniazid preventive treatment (IPT) of close contacts were compared in a decision tree model to perform a cost-benefit analysis with respect to isoniazid related hepatotoxicity and early post-exposure TB over a 2-y period, using the QFT or TST alone or QFT as a confirmatory test for TST results. RESULTS: Cost of screening and treating for using the QFT alone amounted to euro215.79 per close contact, less than that of dual step-testing (euro227.89) or using TST alone (euro232.58). Savings amounted to euro12,200 or euro16,791 per 1000 close contacts, respectively. QFT based procedures were most sensitive to low compliance with IPT or increasing price. Costs of dual step screening was mostly influenced by cost of treating TB disease. When the progression rate for QFT was lowered to that for the TST in a sensitivity analysis, the relationship between the strategies remained robust. In addition, costs of the QFT strategy decreased to euro165.1, and those of the dual step strategy to euro218.4.

JOUR,article,563,The persistence of tuberculosis in the age of DOTS: reassessing the effect of case detection,2009-01-01,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether short-term annual declines of 5-10% in the incidence of tuberculosis (TB) can be sustained over the long term by maintaining high case detection rates (CDRs). METHODS: We constructed a compartmental difference-equation model of a TB epidemic in a hypothetical population of constant size with a treatment success rate of 85%. The impact of CDR on TB incidence was then investigated by generating an equilibrium population with no TB case detection and increasing the smear-positive CDR under two scenarios: (i) rapid expansion by 10% per year to a CDR of 80% after 8 years, and (ii) gradual expansion by 1% per year to a CDR of 90% after 90 years. The model was applied in two hypothetical populations: one without HIV and the other with a stable HIV incidence representative of the African Region. The CDR for smear-negative TB was assumed to be a constant fraction of the smear-positive CDR. FINDINGS: In the absence of a TB control programme, the projected annual incidence of TB was 513 cases per 100 000 population, with a point prevalence of 1233 per 100 000 and an annual TB-specific mortality rate of 182 per 100 000. Immediately increasing the TB CDR from 0% to 70% caused a 74% reduction in TB incidence within 10 years. However, once case detection stabilized at any constant level < 80%, projected TB incidence also stabilized. Ten years after a CDR of 70% was reached, the annual decline in TB incidence was < 1.5%, regardless of how rapidly case detection was scaled up and despite wide variation of all model parameters. CONCLUSION: While improved CDRs have a dramatic short-term effect on TB incidence, maintaining those rates, even at current target levels, may not reduce long-term incidence by more than 1-2% per year. TB control programmes and researchers should vigorously pursue improvements in case detection, regardless of current CDRs.",87,1564-0604 (Electronic),296-304,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19551238,Bull World Health Organ
JOUR,article,746,Slow Elimination of Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis,2009-01-01,"The growing number of reports of antibiotic resistance worldwide has led to fears that some lethal human pathogens, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, will soon become untreatable. Here, we show that, although this is possible, it is not inevitable. The World Health Organization has recently reported more cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis than ever before, but a new analysis of trend data for 10 groups of countries shows how and why the spread of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis can be reversed by good treatment practices. We find that multidrug-resistant tuberculosis is not self-sustaining in 9 out of the 10 settings and conclude that multidrug-resistant tuberculosis can be set on a path-albeit a slow path-to elimination. This result applies even to countries such as Estonia and Latvia, which have exceptionally high prevalence rates of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.",1,1946-6234,NA,<Go to ISI>://000277196700001,Science Translational Medicine
BILL,misc,756,Location of pathogenic bacteria during persistent infections: insights from an analysis using game theory,2009-01-01,"Bacterial persistent infections are responsible for a significant amount of the human morbidity and mortality. Unlike acute bacterial infections, it is very difficult to treat persistent bacterial infections (e.g. tuberculosis). Knowledge about the location of pathogenic bacteria during persistent infection will help to treat such conditions by designing novel drugs which can reach such locations. In this study, events of bacterial persistent infections were analyzed using game theory. A game was defined where the pathogen and the host are the two players with a conflict of interest. Criteria for the establishment of Nash equilibrium were calculated for this game. This theoretical model, which is very simple and heuristic, predicts that during persistent infections pathogenic bacteria stay in both intracellular and extracellular compartments of the host. The result of this study implies that a bacterium should be able to survive in both intracellular and extracellular compartments of the host in order to cause persistent infections. This explains why persistent infections are more often caused by intracellular pathogens like Mycobacterium and Salmonella. Moreover, this prediction is in consistence with the results of previous experimental studies.",4,NA,e5383,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&cmd=Retrieve&dopt=AbstractPlus&list_uids=19401783,PLoS One
JOUR,article,759,A systems biology framework for modeling metabolic enzyme inhibition of Mycobacterium tuberculosis,2009-01-01,"BACKGROUND: Because metabolism is fundamental in sustaining microbial life, drugs that target pathogen-specific metabolic enzymes and pathways can be very effective. In particular, the metabolic challenges faced by intracellular pathogens, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, residing in the infected host provide novel opportunities for therapeutic intervention. RESULTS: We developed a mathematical framework to simulate the effects on the growth of a pathogen when enzymes in its metabolic pathways are inhibited. Combining detailed models of enzyme kinetics, a complete metabolic network description as modeled by flux balance analysis, and a dynamic cell population growth model, we quantitatively modeled and predicted the dose-response of the 3-nitropropionate inhibitor on the growth of M. tuberculosis in a medium whose carbon source was restricted to fatty acids, and that of the 5'-O-(N-salicylsulfamoyl) adenosine inhibitor in a medium with low-iron concentration. CONCLUSION: The predicted results quantitatively reproduced the experimentally measured dose-response curves, ranging over three orders of magnitude in inhibitor concentration. Thus, by allowing for detailed specifications of the underlying enzymatic kinetics, metabolic reactions/constraints, and growth media, our model captured the essential chemical and biological factors that determine the effects of drug inhibition on in vitro growth of M. tuberculosis cells.",3,1752-0509 (Electronic),92,http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/3/92,BMC Syst Biol
JOUR,article,770,Use of a mathematical model to estimate tuberculosis transmission risk in an Internet cafe,2009-01-01,"OBJECTIVE: People who live under fragile living conditions may stay overnight in Internet cafes in urban areas. An outbreak of tuberculosis (TB), the routes of which were possibly related to such a facility, has been reported. The purpose of this study was to use a mathematical model to quantify the public health risk of TB infection in such a facility. METHODS: The reproduction number for airborne infection in an enclosed space (R (A)) was estimated using a Wells-Riley model. First, we estimated R (A) for the TB infection based on the report of the TB outbreak in the Internet cafe. Second, TB infectious dose, number of days of exposure, and air-exchange rate in the facility were varied to estimate the effect of TB risk settings and environmental factors. RESULTS: We assumed that TB patients and 59 susceptible subjects stayed for 150 days in a room where the air-exchange rate was five per hour. Using the estimated median R (A) of 44.14, the TB infection rate was 74.6%. This result was similar to the epidemiological report that the TB infection rate among employees in the Internet cafe was 70%. The median R (A) increased linearly as the number of days of exposure increased. The slope of the change in median R (A) divided by the change in the number of days of exposure increased exponentially as air-exchange rate decreased; thus air ventilation in a facility may be essential to prevent TB infection. CONCLUSIONS: Appropriate air ventilation in facilities such as Internet cafes is needed as part of a TB-control program in metropolitan areas.",14,1342-078X (Print),96-102,http://www.springerlink.com/content/y4p35w852t3768vl/,Environ Health Prev Med
JOUR,article,776,Trade-off between BCG vaccination and the ability to detect and treat latent tuberculosis,2009-01-01,"Policies regarding the use of the Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine for tuberculosis vary greatly throughout the international community. In several countries, consideration of discontinuing universal vaccination programs is currently under way. The arguments against mass vaccination are that the effectiveness of BCG in preventing tuberculosis is uncertain and that BCG vaccination can interfere with the detection and treatment of latent tuberculosis. In this work, we pose a dynamical systems model for the population-level dynamics of tuberculosis in order to study the trade-off which occurs between vaccination and detection/treatment of latent tuberculosis. We assume that latent infection in vaccinated individuals is completely undetectable. For the case of a country with very low levels of tuberculosis, we establish analytic thresholds, via stability analysis and the basic reproductive number, which determine the optimal vaccination policy, given the effectiveness of the vaccine and the detection/treatment rate of latent tuberculosis. The results of this work suggest that it is unlikely that a country detects and treats latent tuberculosis at a high enough rate to justify the discontinuation of mass vaccination from this perspective.",261,1095-8541 (Electronic),548-60,http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0022519309004093/1-s2.0-S0022519309004093-main.pdf?_tid=6bfa50d3f1b770ab01fcb7f24051a839&acdnat=1345012389_7a7e0c6069b2a2bc442ddf8e87662ebe,J Theor Biol

This has been a considerable barrier to understanding latent tuberculosis, and efforts to develop new therapies generally assume that the bacteria are very slowly replicating or nonreplicating during latency. To monitor Mycobacterium tuberculosis replication within hosts, we exploit an unstable plasmid that is lost at a steady, quantifiable rate from dividing cells in the absence of antibiotic selection. By applying a mathematical model, we calculate bacterial growth and death rates during infection of mice. We show that during chronic infection, the cumulative bacterial burden-enumerating total live, dead and removed organisms encountered by the mouse lung-is substantially higher than estimates from colony-forming units. Our data show that M. tuberculosis replicates throughout the course of chronic infection of mice and is restrained by the host immune system.

JOUR,article,789,Population modeling and Monte Carlo simulation study of the pharmacokinetics and antituberculosis pharmacodynamics of rifampin in lungs,2009-01-01,"Little information exists on the pulmonary pharmacology of antituberculosis drugs. We used population pharmacokinetic modeling and Monte Carlo simulation to describe and explore the pulmonary pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of rifampin (RIF; rifampicin). A population pharmacokinetic model that adequately described the plasma, epithelial lining fluid (ELF), and alveolar cell (AC) concentrations of RIF in a population of 34 human volunteers was made by use of the nonparametric adaptive grid (NPAG) algorithm. The estimated concentrations correlated well with the measured concentrations, and there was little bias and good precision. The results obtained with the NPAG algorithm were then imported into Matlab software to perform a 10,000-subject Monte Carlo simulation. The ability of RIF to suppress the development of drug resistance and to induce a sufficient bactericidal effect against Mycobacterium tuberculosis was evaluated by calculating the proportion of subjects achieving specific target values for the maximum concentration of drug (C(max))/MIC ratio and the area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to 24 h (AUC(0-24))/MIC ratio, respectively. At the lowest MIC (0.01 mg/liter), after the administration of one 600-mg oral dose, the rates of target attainment for C(max)/MIC (> or =175) were 95% in ACs, 48.8% in plasma, and 35.9% in ELF. Under the same conditions, the target attainment results for the killing effect were 100% in plasma (AUC(0-24)/MIC > or = 271) but only 54.5% in ELF (AUC(0-24)/MIC > or = 665). The use of a 1,200-mg RIF dose was associated with better results for target attainment. The overall results suggest that the pulmonary concentrations obtained with the standard RIF dose are too low in most subjects. This work supports the need to evaluate higher doses of RIF for the treatment of patients with tuberculosis.",53,1098-6596 (Electronic),2974-81,http://aac.asm.org/content/53/7/2974.full.pdf,Antimicrob Agents Chemother
JOUR,article,806,Modelling local and global effects on the risk of contracting Tuberculosis using stochastic Markov-chain models,2009-01-01,"For some diseases, the transmission of infection can cause spatial clustering of disease cases. This clustering has an impact on how one estimates the rate of the spread of the disease and on the design of control strategies. It is, however, difficult to assess such clustering, (local effects on transmission), using traditional statistical methods. A stochastic Markov-chain model that takes into account possible local or more dispersed global effects on the risk of contracting disease is introduced in the context of the transmission dynamics of tuberculosis. The model is used to analyse TB notifications collected in the Asembo and Gem Divisions of Nyanza Province in western Kenya by the Kenya Ministry of Health/National Leprosy and Tuberculosis Program and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The model shows evidence of a pronounced local effect that is significantly greater than the global effect. We discuss a number of variations of the model which identify how this local effect depends on factors such as age and gender. Zoning/clustering of villages is used to identify the influence that zone size has on the model's ability to distinguish local and global effects. An important possible use of the model is in the design of a community randomised trial where geographical clusters of people are divided into two groups and the effectiveness of an intervention policy is assessed by applying it to one group but not the other. Here the model can be used to take the effect of case clustering into consideration in calculating the minimum difference in an outcome variable (e.g. disease prevalence) that can be detected with statistical significance. It thereby gauges the potential effectiveness of such a trial. Such a possible application is illustrated with the given time/spatial TB data set.",218,1879-3134 (Electronic),98-104,http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0025556409000212/1-s2.0-S0025556409000212-main.pdf?_tid=77817aaa05622369ca0d29b39ce4a269&acdnat=1345012489_4856d1ca7ba758754fdd87eb5d14dd13,Math Biosci
JOUR,article,807,Costs and cost-effectiveness of four treatment regimens for latent tuberculosis infection,2009-01-01,"RATIONALE: Isoniazid given daily for 9 months is the standard treatment for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), but its effectiveness is limited by poor completion rates. Shorter course regimens and regimens using directly observed therapy result in improved adherence but have higher upfront costs. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the costs and cost-effectiveness of regimens for the treatment of LTBI. METHODS: We used a computerized Markov model to estimate total societal costs and benefits associated with four regimens for the treatment of LTBI: self-administered isoniazid daily for 9 months, directly observed isoniazid twice-weekly for 9 months, directly observed isoniazid plus rifapentine once weekly for 3 months, and self-administered rifampin daily for 4 months. In the base-case analysis, subjects were assumed to have newly positive tuberculin skin tests after recent exposure to infectious tuberculosis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We determined the costs of treatment, quality-adjusted life-years gained, and cases of active tuberculosis prevented. In the base-case analysis, rifampin dominated (less costly with increased benefits) all other regimens except isoniazid plus rifapentine, which was more effective at a cost $48,997 per quality-adjusted life year gained. Isoniazid plus rifapentine dominated all regimens at a relative risk of disease 5.2 times the baseline estimate, or with completion rates less than 34% for isoniazid or 37% for rifampin. Rifampin could be 17% less efficacious than self-administered isoniazid and still be cost-saving compared with this regimen. CONCLUSIONS: In our model, rifampin is cost-saving compared with the standard therapy of self-administered isoniazid. Isoniazid plus rifapentine is cost-saving for extremely high-risk patients and is cost-effective for lower-risk patients.",179,1535-4970; 1073-449X,1055-1060,NA,American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine

JOUR,article,850,The epidemiological fitness cost of drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis,2009-01-01,"The emergence of antibiotic resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis has raised the concern that pathogen strains that are virtually untreatable may become widespread. The acquisition of resistance to antibiotics results in a longer duration of infection in a host, but this resistance may come at a cost through a decreased transmission rate. This raises the question of whether the overall fitness of drug-resistant strains is higher than that of sensitive strains--essential information for predicting the spread of the disease. Here, we directly estimate the transmission cost of drug resistance, the rate at which resistance evolves, and the relative fitness of resistant strains. These estimates are made by using explicit models of the transmission and evolution of sensitive and resistant strains of M. tuberculosis, using approximate Bayesian computation, and molecular epidemiology data from Cuba, Estonia, and Venezuela. We find that the transmission cost of drug resistance relative to sensitivity can be as low as 10%, that resistance evolves at rates of approximately 0.0025-0.02 per case per year, and that the overall fitness of resistant strains is comparable with that of sensitive strains. Furthermore, the contribution of transmission to the spread of drug resistance is very high compared with acquired resistance due to treatment failure (up to 99%). Estimating such parameters directly from in vivo data will be critical to understanding and responding to antibiotic resistance. For instance, projections using our estimates suggest that the prevalence of tuberculosis may decline with successful treatment, but the proportion of cases associated with resistance is likely to increase.",106,1091-6490 (Electronic),14711-14715,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&dopt=Citation&list_uids=19706556,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA

The host population is divided into four sub classes of susceptibles, TB infectives, HIV infectives (with or without TB) and that of AIDS patients. The model exhibits four equilibria namely, a disease free, HIV free, TB free and an endemic equilibrium. The model has been studied qualitatively using stability theory of nonlinear differential equations and computer simulation. We have found a threshold parameter R 0 which is if less than one, the disease free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable otherwise for R 0 &gt; 1 , at least one of the infections will be present in the population. It is shown that the positive endemic equilibrium is always locally stable but it may become globally stable under certain conditions showing that the disease becomes endemic. It is found that as the number of TB infectives decreases due to recovery, the number of HIV infectives also decreases and endemic equilibrium tends to TB free equilibrium. It is also observed that number of AIDS individuals decreases if TB is not associated with HIV infection.

JOUR,article,926,Heterogeneity in susceptibility to infection can explain high reinfection rates,2009-01-01,"Heterogeneity in susceptibility and infectivity is inherent to infectious disease transmission in nature. Here we are concerned with the formulation of mathematical models that capture the essence of heterogeneity while keeping a simple structure suitable of analytical treatment. We explore the consequences of host heterogeneity in the susceptibility to infection for epidemiological models for which immunity conferred by infection is partially protective, known as susceptible-infected-recovered-infected (SIRI) models. We analyze the impact of heterogeneity on disease prevalence and contrast the susceptibility profiles of the subpopulations at risk for primary infection and reinfection. We present a systematic study in the case of two frailty groups. We predict that the average rate of reinfection may be higher than the average rate of primary infection, which may seem paradoxical given that primary infection induces life-long partial protection. Infection generates a selection mechanism whereby fit individuals remain in S and frail individuals are transferred to R. If this effect is strong enough we have a scenario where, on average, the rate of reinfection is higher than the rate of primary infection even though each individual has a risk reduction following primary infection. This mechanism may explain high rates of tuberculosis reinfection recently reported. Finally, the enhanced benefits of vaccination strategies that target the high-risk groups are quantified.",259,1095-8541 (Electronic),280-90,http://ac.els-cdn.com/S002251930900126X/1-s2.0-S002251930900126X-main.pdf?_tid=0e76250e4b0924442f25d4e7f94d036f&acdnat=1345013156_bb0915944646b87f81a0b0a2e026cb6c,J Theor Biol
JOUR,article,595,Modeling TB and HIV co-infections,2009-01-01,"Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death among individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The study of the joint dynamics of HIV and TB present formidable mathematical challenges due to the fact that the models of transmission are quite distinct. Furthermore, although there is overlap in the populations at risk of HIV and TB infections, the magnitude of the proportion of individuals at risk for both diseases is not known. Here, we consider a highly simplified deterministic model that incorporates the joint dynamics of TB and HIV, a model that is quite hard to analyze. We compute independent reproductive numbers for TB (R1) and HIV (R2) and the overall reproductive number for the system, R=max{R1, R2}. The focus is naturally (given the highly simplified nature of the framework) on the qualitative analysis of this model. We find that if R < 1 then the disease-free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable. The TB-only equilibrium ET is locally asymptotically stable if R1 < 1 and R2 < 1. However, the symmetric condition, R1 < 1 and R2 > 1, does not necessarily guarantee the stability of the HIV-only equilibrium EH, and it is possible that TB can coexist with HIV when R2 > 1. In other words, in the case when R1 < 1 and R2 > 1 (or when R1 > 1 and R2 > 1), we are able to find a stable HIV/TB coexistence equilibrium. Moreover, we show that the prevalence level of TB increases with R2 > 1 under certain conditions. Through simulations, we find that i) the increased progression rate from latent to active TB in co-infected individuals may play a significant role in the rising prevalence of TB; and ii) the increased progression rates from HIV to AIDS have not only increased the prevalence level of HIV while decreasing TB prevalence, but also generated damped oscillations in the system.",6,1547-1063 (Print),815-37,NA,Math Biosci Eng
JOUR,article,598,Incongruent HIV and tuberculosis co-dynamics in Kenya: interacting epidemics monitor each other,2009-01-01,"OBJECTIVE: Kenya is heralded as an example of declining HIV in Africa, while its tuberculosis (TB) numbers continue rising. We conducted a comparative investigation of TB-HIV co-dynamics in Africa to determine the likelihood of reported trends. METHODS AND RESULTS: Our mathematical modeling analysis exposes the notable incongruence of reported trends in Kenya because TB-HIV co-dynamics, tightly knit worldwide and most dramatically in sub-Saharan Africa, suggest that declining HIV trends should trigger reductions in TB trends. Moreover, a continental-scale analysis of TB-HIV trends places Kenya as an outlier in eastern and southern Africa, and shows TB outpacing HIV in western central Africa. We further investigate which TB processes across HIV stages have greater potential to reduce TB incidence via a sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSIONS: There are two parsimonious explanations: an unaccounted improvement in TB case detection has occurred, or HIV is not declining as reported. The TB-HIV mismatch could be compounded by surveillance biases due to spatial heterogeneity in disease dynamics. Results highlight the need to re-evaluate trends of both diseases in Kenya, and identify the most critical epidemiological factors at play. Substantial demographic changes have occurred in Kenya, including rapid urbanization accompanied by poor living conditions, which could disproportionately increase TB incidence. Other possible contributors include immune reconstitution due to the recent delivery of antiretrovirals, and an increased presence of the virulent Beijing/W TB genotype.

JOUR,article,987,Tuberculosis reinfection rate as a proportion of total infection rate correlates with the logarithm of the incidence rate: a mathematical model,2009-01-01,"In a significant number of instances, an episode of tuberculosis can be attributed to a reinfection event. Because reinfection is more likely in high incidence regions than in regions of low incidence, more tuberculosis (TB) cases due to reinfection could be expected in high-incidence regions than in low-incidence regions. Empirical data from regions with various incidence rates appear to confirm the conjecture that, in fact, the incidence rate due to reinfection only, as a proportion of all cases, correlates with the logarithm of the incidence rate, rather than with the incidence rate itself. A theoretical model that supports this conjecture is presented. A Markov model was used to obtain a relationship between incidence and reinfection rates. It was assumed in this model that the rate of reinfection is a multiple, rho (the reinfection factor), of the rate of first-time infection, lambda. The results obtained show a relationship between the proportion of cases due to reinfection and the rate of incidence that is approximately logarithmic for a range of values of the incidence rate typical of those observed in communities across the globe. A value of rho is determined such that the relationship between the proportion of cases due to reinfection and the logarithm of the incidence rate closely correlates with empirical data. From a purely theoretical investigation, it is shown that a simple relationship can be expected between the logarithm of the incidence rates and the proportions of cases due to reinfection after a prior episode of TB. This relationship is sustained by a rate of reinfection that is higher than the rate of first-time infection and this latter consideration underscores the great importance of monitoring recovered TB cases for repeat disease episodes, especially in regions where TB incidence is high. Awareness of this may assist in attempts to control the epidemic.",6,1742-5689 (Print),11-5,http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/6/30/11.full.pdf,J R Soc Interface
JOUR,article,988,Potential of rapid diagnosis for controlling drug-susceptible and drug-resistant tuberculosis in communities where Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections are highly prevalent,2009-01-01,"The long-term persistence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in communities with high tuberculosis prevalence is a serious problem aggravated by the presence of drug-resistant tuberculosis strains. Drug resistance in an individual patient is often discovered only after a long delay, particularly if the diagnosis is based on current culture-based drug sensitivity testing methods. During such delays, the patient may transmit tuberculosis to his or her contacts. Rapid diagnosis of drug resistance would be expected to reduce this transmission and hence to decrease the prevalence of drug-resistant strains. To investigate this quantitatively, a mathematical model was constructed, assuming a homogeneous population structure typical of communities in South Africa where tuberculosis incidence is high. Computer simulations performed with this model showed that current control strategies will not halt the spread of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in such communities. The simulations showed that the rapid diagnosis of drug resistance can be expected to reduce the incidence of drug-resistant cases provided the additional measure of screening within the community is implemented.",47,1098-660X (Electronic),1484-90,http://jcm.asm.org/content/47/5/1484.full.pdf,J Clin Microbiol

For the purpose of planning future TB-control activities we estimated the number of TB patients in The Netherlands up to 2030. METHODS: Statistical modelling for 5-year age groups up to 2030 distinguishing among Dutch TB patients infected by a Dutch source (survival model), non-Dutch patients (projection of the proportion of culture-positive patients among first generation immigrants) and Dutch patients infected by a non-Dutch source (fixed relation with the number of non-Dutch patients). RESULTS: The number of TB patients is expected to decline to 877 in 2030. After 2010 declines may slow due to an increase in non-Dutch TB patients. This increase cancels out the decrease of Dutch TB patients infected by a Dutch source. In 2030, 85% of all TB patients are expected to be non-Dutch. In the four largest counties and the rest of The Netherlands, this will be 89 and 76%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The decrease in TB incidence observed over many years may stall from 2010 onwards because of an estimated increase in non-Dutch TB patients. Given their disproportionate burden, future TB-control activities should prioritize the health of first-generation immigrants. Enhanced TB control in the countries of origin and new diagnostic tests to identify those at high risk of developing active TB could help in reducing further the TB incidence in the Netherlands.

JOUR,article,655,Modeling metabolic adjustment in Mycobacterium tuberculosis upon treatment with isoniazid,2010-01-01,"Complex biological systems exhibit a property of robustness at all levels of organization. Through different mechanisms, the system tries to sustain stress such as due to starvation or drug exposure. To explore whether reconfiguration of the metabolic networks is used as a means to achieve robustness, we have studied possible metabolic adjustments in Mtb upon exposure to isoniazid (INH), a front-line clinical drug. The redundancy in the genome of M. tuberculosis (Mtb) makes it an attractive system to explore if alternate routes of metabolism exist in the bacterium. While the mechanism of action of INH is well studied, its effect on the overall metabolism is not well characterized. Using flux balance analysis, inhibiting the fluxes flowing through the reactions catalyzed by Rv1484, the target of INH, significantly changes the overall flux profiles. At the pathway level, activation or inactivation of certain pathways distant from the target pathway, are seen. Metabolites such as NADPH are shown to reduce drastically, while fatty acids tend to accumulate. The overall biomass also decreases with increasing inhibition levels.

JOUR,article,556,Added value of bleach sedimentation microscopy for diagnosis of tuberculosis: a cost-effectiveness study,2010-01-01,"SETTING: Bleach sedimentation is a method used to increase the diagnostic yield of sputum microscopy for countries with a high prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and limited resources. OBJECTIVES: To compare the relative cost-effectiveness of different microscopy approaches in diagnosing tuberculosis (TB) in Kenya. METHODS: An analytical decision tree model including cost and effectiveness measures of 10 combinations of direct (D) and overnight bleach (B) sedimentation microscopy was constructed. Data were drawn from the evaluation of the bleach sedimentation method on two specimens (first on the spot [1] and second morning [2]) from 644 TB suspects in a peripheral health clinic. Incremental cost per smear-positive detected case was measured. Costs included human resources and materials using a micro-costing evaluation. RESULTS: All bleach-based microscopy approaches detected significantly more cases (between 23.3% for B1 and 25.9% for B1+B2) than the conventional D1+D2 approach (21.0%). Cost per tested case ranged between respectively euro 2.7 and euro 4.5 for B1 and B1+D2+B2. B1 and B1+B2 were the most cost-effective approaches. D1+B2 and D1+B1 were good alternatives to avoid using approaches exclusively based on bleach sedimentation microscopy. CONCLUSIONS: Among several effective microscopy approaches used, including sodium hypochlorite sedimentation, only some resulted in a limited increase in the laboratory workload and would be most suitable for programmatic implementation.",14,1815-7920 (Electronic),571-7,NA,International Journal of Tuberculosis and Lung Disease
JOUR,article,679,The impact of realistic age structure in simple models of tuberculosis transmission,2010-01-01,"BACKGROUND: Mathematical models of tuberculosis (TB) transmission have been used to characterize disease dynamics, investigate the potential effects of public health interventions, and prioritize control measures. While previous work has addressed the mathematical description of TB natural history, the impact of demography on the behaviour of TB models has not been assessed. METHODS: A simple model of TB transmission, with alternative assumptions about survivorship, is used to explore the effect of age structure on the prevalence of infection, disease, basic reproductive ratio and the projected impact of control interventions. We focus our analytic arguments on the differences between constant and exponentially distributed lifespans and use an individual-based model to investigate the range of behaviour arising from realistic distributions of survivorship. RESULTS: The choice of age structure and natural (non-disease related) mortality strongly affects steady-state dynamics, parameter estimation and predictions about the effectiveness of control interventions. Since most individuals infected with TB develop an asymptomatic latent infection and never progress to active disease, we find that assuming a constant mortality rate results in a larger reproductive ratio and an overestimation of the effort required for disease control in comparison to using more realistic age-specific mortality rates. CONCLUSIONS: Demographic modelling assumptions should be considered in the interpretation of models of chronic infectious diseases such as TB. For simple models, we find that assuming constant lifetimes, rather than exponential lifetimes, produces dynamics more representative of models with realistic age structure.",5,1932-6203 (Electronic),e8479,http://www.plosone.org/article/fetchObjectAttachment.action?uri=info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0008479&representation=PDF,PLoS One
JOUR,article,680,Mathematical modeling of tuberculosis bacillary counts and cellular populations in the organs of infected mice,2010-01-01,"BACKGROUND: Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a particularly aggressive microorganism and the host's defense is based on the induction of cellular immunity, in which the creation of a granulomatous structure has an important role. METHODOLOGY: We present here a new 2D cellular automata model based on the concept of a multifunctional process that includes key factors such as the chemokine attraction of the cells; the role of innate immunity triggered by natural killers; the presence of neutrophils; apoptosis and necrosis of infected macrophages; the removal of dead cells by macrophages, which induces the production of foamy macrophages (FMs); the life cycle of the bacilli as a determinant for the evolution of infected macrophages; and the immune response. RESULTS: The results obtained after the inclusion of two degrees of tolerance to the inflammatory response triggered by the infection shows that the model can cover a wide spectrum, ranging from highly-tolerant (i.e. mice) to poorly-tolerant hosts (i.e. mini-pigs or humans). CONCLUSIONS: This model suggest that stopping bacillary growth at the onset of the infection might be difficult and the important role played by FMs in bacillary drainage in poorly-tolerant hosts together with apoptosis and innate lymphocytes. It also shows the poor ability of the cellular immunity to control the infection, provides a clear protective character to the granuloma, due its ability to attract a sufficient number of cells, and explains why an already infected host can be constantly reinfected.",5,1932-6203 (Electronic),e12985,http://www.plosone.org/article/fetchObjectAttachment.action?uri=info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0012985&representation=PDF,PLoS One

JOUR,article,690,Probabilistic integrative modeling of genome-scale metabolic and regulatory networks in Escherichia coli and Mycobacterium tuberculosis,2010-01-01,"Prediction of metabolic changes that result from genetic or environmental perturbations has several important applications, including diagnosing metabolic disorders and discovering novel drug targets. A cardinal challenge in obtaining accurate predictions is the integration of transcriptional regulatory networks with the corresponding metabolic network. We propose a method called probabilistic regulation of metabolism (PROM) that achieves this synthesis and enables straightforward, automated, and quantitative integration of high-throughput data into constraint-based modeling, making it an ideal tool for constructing genome-scale regulatory-metabolic network models for less-studied organisms. PROM introduces probabilities to represent gene states and gene-transcription factor interactions. By using PROM, we constructed an integrated regulatory-metabolic network for the model organism, Escherichia coli, and demonstrated that our method based on automated inference is more accurate and comprehensive than the current state of the art, which is based on manual curation of literature. After validating the approach, we used PROM to build a genome-scale integrated metabolic-regulatory model for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a critically important human pathogen. This study incorporated data from more than 1,300 microarrays, 2,000 transcription factor-target interactions regulating 3,300 metabolic reactions, and 1,905 KO phenotypes for E. coli and M. tuberculosis. PROM identified KO phenotypes with accuracies as high as 95%, and predicted growth rates quantitatively with correlation of 0.95. Importantly, PROM represents the successful integration of a top-down reconstructed, statistically inferred regulatory network with a bottom-up reconstructed, biochemically detailed metabolic network, bridging two important classes of systems biology models that are rarely combined quantitatively.",107,1091-6490 (Electronic),17845-50,http://www.pnas.org/content/107/41/17845.full.pdf,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA
JOUR,article,1420,Liquid vs. solid culture for tuberculosis: performance and cost in a resource-constrained setting,2010-01-01,"SETTING: National Health Laboratory Services tuberculosis (TB) laboratory, South Africa. OBJECTIVES: To compare Mycobacterium Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT) with Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ) medium with regard to Mycobacterium tuberculosis yield, time to positive culture and contamination, and to assess MGIT cost-effectiveness. DESIGN: Sputum from gold miners was cultured on MGIT and LJ. We estimated cost per culture, and, for smear-negative samples, incremental cost per additional M. tuberculosis gained with MGIT using a decision-tree model. RESULTS: Among 1267 specimens, MGIT vs. LJ gave a higher yield of mycobacteria (29.7% vs. 22.8%), higher contamination (16.7% vs. 9.3%) and shorter time to positive culture (median 14 vs. 25 days for smear-negative specimens). Among smear-negative samples that were culture-positive on MGIT but negative/contaminated on LJ, 77.3% were non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). Cost per culture on LJ, MGIT and MGIT+LJ was respectively US$12.35, US$16.62 and US$19.29. The incremental cost per additional M. tuberculosis identified by standard biochemical tests and microscopic cording was respectively US$504.08 and US$328.10 using MGIT vs. LJ, or US$160.80 and US$$109.07 using MGIT+LJ vs. LJ alone. CONCLUSION: MGIT gives higher yield and faster results at relatively high cost. The high proportion of NTM underscores the need for rapid speciation tests. Minimising contaminated cultures is key to cost-effectiveness.",14,1815-7920 (Electronic),1024-31,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20626948,International Journal of Tuberculosis and Lung Disease
JOUR,article,557,A pressure model of immune response to mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in several space dimensions,2010-01-01,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is a widely diffused infection. However, in general, the human immune system is able to contain it. In this work, we propose a mathematical model which describes the early immune response to the Mtb infection in the lungs, also including the possible evolution of the infection in the formation of a granuloma. The model is based on coupled reaction-diffusion-transport equations with chemotaxis, which take into account the interactions among bacteria, macrophages and chemoattractant. The novelty of this approach is in the modeling of the velocity field, proportional to the gradient of the pressure developed between the cells, which makes possible to deal with a full multidimensional description and efficient numerical simulations. We perform a linear stability analysis of the model and propose a robust implicit-explicit scheme to deal with long time simulations. Both in one and two-dimensions, we find that there are threshold values in the parameters space, between a contained infection and the uncontrolled bacteria growth, and the generation of granuloma-like patterns can be observed numerically.",7,1551-0018 (Electronic),277-300,NA,Math Biosci Eng
JOUR,article,701,Estimating the magnitude and direction of bias in tuberculosis drug resistance surveys conducted only in the public sector: a simulation study,2010-01-01,"BACKGROUND: Accurate assessment of the burden of drug-resistant TB requires systematic efforts to quantify its magnitude and trend. In approximately half the countries where resistance has been reported, estimates are based on surveys conducted in public sector facilities. However, in locations where a substantial fraction of TB cases seek care with private providers, these surveys may not accurately measure resistance in the entire population. METHODS: We describe a mathematical model to investigate biases associated with sampling only from public sector cases in India, where TB treatment is offered in both public and private sectors. We then propose and demonstrate a weighted estimator as an efficient method for including small numbers of cases from the private sector as a way to recover valid estimates of resistance in the population under study. RESULTS: We find that public sector surveys rarely provide valid estimates of drug-resistance among new and retreatment cases. Further, the magnitude and direction of the bias are sensitive to many parameters describing the health-seeking behaviours and treatment outcomes of tuberculosis patients, disallowing simple adjustments to recover accurate estimates. CONCLUSIONS: In locations where large numbers of tuberculosis patients are diagnosed and treated by private sector practitioners who are not typically included in drug resistance surveys, targeted surveys for assessing drug resistance are required to validly estimate resistance.",10,1471-2458 (Electronic),355,http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/10/355,BMC Public Health

METHODS: A decision analysis model evaluated three strategies among simulated adults in close contact with tuberculosis (TB). We calculated direct lifetime medical costs, life expectancies and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS: The discounted direct medical costs of care per patient of no testing, TST, QFT and TST+QFT were respectively euro417, euro476, euro443 and euro435, while discounted life expectancies were respectively 25.030, 25.071, 25.073 and 25.062 years. TST had higher costs and lower efficacy than QFT; TST+QFT was associated with an ICER of euro560 per year of life gained (YLG) compared to no testing, and QFT was associated with an ICER of euro730/YLG compared to TST+QFT. The only scenario where QFT was associated with an ICER of >euro75 000/YLG was when the prevalence of LTBI around TB was low (<5%) and TST specificity high (>90%). CONCLUSIONS: In France, for the diagnosis of LTBI after close contact with TB, the TST is more expensive and less effective than QFT. Although it is more expensive, QFT is more effective and cost-effective than TST+QFT under a wide range of realistic test performance scenarios.",14,1815-7920 (Electronic),471-81,NA,International Journal of Tuberculosis and Lung Disease
JOUR,article,758,Identification of key processes that control tumor necrosis factor availability in a tuberculosis granuloma,2010-01-01,"Tuberculosis (TB) granulomas are organized collections of immune cells comprised of macrophages, lymphocytes and other cells that form in the lung as a result of immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. Formation and maintenance of granulomas are essential for control of Mtb infection and are regulated in part by a pro-inflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF). To characterize mechanisms that control TNF availability within a TB granuloma, we developed a multi-scale two compartment partial differential equation model that describes a granuloma as a collection of immune cells forming concentric layers and includes TNF/TNF receptor binding and trafficking processes. We used the results of sensitivity analysis as a tool to identify experiments to measure critical model parameters in an artificial experimental model of a TB granuloma induced in the lungs of mice following injection of mycobacterial antigen-coated beads. Using our model, we then demonstrated that the organization of immune cells within a TB granuloma as well as TNF/TNF receptor binding and intracellular trafficking are two important factors that control TNF availability and may spatially coordinate TNF-induced immunological functions within a granuloma. Further, we showed that the neutralization power of TNF-neutralizing drugs depends on their TNF binding characteristics, including TNF binding kinetics, ability to bind to membrane-bound TNF and TNF binding stoichiometry. To further elucidate the role of TNF in the process of granuloma development, our modeling and experimental findings on TNF-associated molecular scale aspects of the granuloma can be incorporated into larger scale models describing the immune response to TB infection. Ultimately, these modeling and experimental results can help identify new strategies for TB disease control/therapy.",6,1553-7358 (Electronic),e1000778,http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/fetchObjectAttachment.action?uri=info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1000778&representation=PDF,PLoS Comput Biol
JOUR,article,828,Cost effectiveness of interferon-gamma release assay versus chest X-ray for tuberculosis screening of BCG-vaccinated elderly populations,2010-01-01,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of tuberculosis (TB) in the elderly is higher than that in the general population, and elderly populations are considered a high-risk group. Currently, annual TB screening of Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG)-vaccinated people aged over 65 years is performed by an annual chest x-ray examination (CXR) in Japan. Interferon-gamma release assays (QuantiFERON-TB Gold and QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube [QFT]) are new alternatives to the tuberculin skin test to diagnose latent TB infection (LTBI) that have no cross-reactivity with the BCG vaccine. We evaluated the cost effectiveness of QFT versus CXR versus no screening in BCG-vaccinated elderly populations. METHODS: We constructed a Markov model to evaluate the cost effectiveness of QFT, CXR, and no screening. The target population was a hypothetical cohort of 1000 immunocompetent 65-year-olds, using a societal perspective and a lifetime horizon. All costs and clinical benefits were discounted at a fixed annual rate of 3%. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, a no-screening strategy resulted in the lowest cost ($US303.51; 14.6475 quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]) compared with CXR ($US393.22; 14.6477 QALYs) and QFT ($US525.45; 14.6516 QALYs) [year 2008 values]. The sensitivity of QFT, as well as the prevalence of TB and LTBI, influenced the cost effectiveness; when the sensitivity of QFT was higher than 0.89, QFT became more cost effective than providing no screening. As the prevalence of LTBI and TB increased, the QFT strategy became progressively more cost effective. CONCLUSIONS: Providing no routine TB screening is currently the most cost-effective strategy for BCG-vaccinated elderly populations in Japan. There appears to be little role for CXR in TB screening of elderly populations. These findings may be applicable to other countries with intermediate and high TB risks when choosing optimal TB screening of elderly populations.",14,1177-1062 (Print),229-36,NA,Mol Diagn Ther

Numerical simulations indicate that there may be a unique positive periodic solution which is globally asymptotically stable if R(0)>1.

Its causative agent is the bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Cytokine-mediated macrophage activation is a necessary step in control of bacterial growth, and early immunologic events in lymph node and lung are crucial to the outcome of infection, although the factors that influence these environments and the immune response are poorly understood. Our goal is to build the next-generation two-compartmental model of the immune response to provide a gateway to more spatial and mechanistic investigations of M. tuberculosis infection in the LN and lung. Crucial immune factors emerge that affect macrophage populations and inflammation, namely TNF-dependent recruitment and apoptosis, and IL-10 levels. Surprisingly, bacterial load plays a less important role than TNF in increasing the population of infected macrophages and inflammation. Using a mathematical model, it is possible to distinguish the effects of pro-inflammatory (TNF) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10) cytokines on the spectrum of phagocyte populations (macrophages and dendritic cells) in the lung and lymph node. Our results suggest that TNF is a major mediator of recruitment of phagocytes to the lungs.

A computational model of this interaction network, which encodes complex interplay among host and bacterial components, forms a useful basis for improving the understanding of pathogenesis, in filling knowledge gaps and consequently to identify strategies to counter the disease. We have built an extensive model of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis host-pathogen interactome, consisting of 75 nodes corresponding to host and pathogen molecules, cells, cellular states or processes. Vaccination effects, clearance efficiencies due to drugs and growth rates have also been encoded in the model. The system is modelled as a Boolean network. Virtual deletion experiments, multiple parameter scans and analysis of the system's response to perturbations, indicate that disabling processes such as phagocytosis and phagolysosome fusion or cytokines such as TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma, greatly impaired bacterial clearance, while removing cytokines such as IL-10 alongside bacterial defence proteins such as SapM greatly favour clearance.

JOUR,article,985,Cost-effectiveness of HIV testing referral strategies among tuberculosis patients in India,2010-01-01,"BACKGROUND: Indian guidelines recommend routine referral for HIV testing of all tuberculosis (TB) patients in the nine states with the highest HIV prevalence, and selective referral for testing elsewhere. We assessed the clinical impact and cost-effectiveness of alternative HIV testing referral strategies among TB patients in India. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We utilized a computer model of HIV and TB disease to project outcomes for patients with active TB in India. We compared life expectancy, cost, and cost-effectiveness for three HIV testing referral strategies: 1) selective referral for HIV testing of those with increased HIV risk, 2) routine referral of patients in the nine highest HIV prevalence states with selective referral elsewhere (current standard), and 3) routine referral of all patients for HIV testing. TB-related data were from the World Health Organization. HIV prevalence among TB patients was 9.0% in the highest prevalence states, 2.9% in the other states, and 4.9% overall. The selective referral strategy, beginning from age 33.50 years, had a projected discounted life expectancy of 16.88 years and a mean lifetime HIV/TB treatment cost of US$100. The current standard increased mean life expectancy to 16.90 years with additional per-person cost of US$10; the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was US$650/year of life saved (YLS) compared to selective referral. Routine referral of all patients for HIV testing increased life expectancy to 16.91 years, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of US$730/YLS compared to the current standard. For HIV-infected patients cured of TB, receiving antiretroviral therapy increased survival from 4.71 to 13.87 years. Results were most sensitive to the HIV prevalence and the cost of second-line antiretroviral therapy.

JOUR,article,612,Antiretroviral therapy for tuberculosis control in nine African countries,2010-01-01,"HIV has increased the incidence of tuberculosis (TB) by up to sevenfold in African countries, but antiretroviral therapy (ART) reduces the incidence of AIDS-related TB. We use a mathematical model to investigate the short-term and long-term impacts of ART on the incidence of TB, assuming that people are tested for HIV once a year, on average, and start ART at a fixed time after HIV seroconversion or at a fixed CD4(+) cell count. We fit the model to trend data on HIV prevalence and TB incidence in nine countries in sub-Saharan Africa. If HIV-positive people start ART within 5 y of seroconversion, the incidence of AIDS-related TB in 2015 will be reduced by 48% (range: 37-55%). Long-term reductions depend sensitively on the delay to starting ART. If treatment is started 5, 2, or 1 y after HIV seroconversion, or as soon as people test positive, the incidence in 2050 will be reduced by 66% (range: 57-80%), 95% (range: 93-96%), 97.7% (range: 96.9-98.2%) and 98.4% (range: 97.8-98.9%), respectively.

JOUR,article,614,Tuberculosis transmission to young children in a South African community: modeling household and community infection risks,2010-01-01,"BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis transmission is determined by contact between infectious and susceptible individuals. A recent study reported a 4% annual risk of child tuberculosis infection in a southern African township. A model was used to explore the interactions between prevalence of adult tuberculosis infection, adult-to-child contacts, and household ventilation, which could result in such a high annual risk of tuberculosis infection. METHODS: Number of residents per household and tuberculosis incidence were derived from a household census and community tuberculosis registers. Using the Wells-Riley equation and probability analyses of contact between infectious adults with tuberculosis and preschool children, we estimated the annual risk of tuberculosis infection within and outside of the home. RESULTS: There was a mean of 2.2 adults per child-containing household with a 1.35% annual adult smear-positive tuberculosis notification rate. The maximal household annual risk of tuberculosis infection was 3%, which was primarily determined by the number of resident adults. Transmission risk outside the home increased with increasing number of households visited. Transmission probabilities were sensitive to exposure time, ventilation, and period of adult infectivity. The benefits of increased ventilation were greatest when the period of infectivity was reduced. Similar reductions in household transmission could be achieved by increasing ventilation from 2 to 6 air changes/hour or by separating child and adult sleeping areas. CONCLUSIONS: The annual risk of tuberculosis infection of preschool children predominantly results from infectious residents in the home. However, even with limited social interactions, a substantial proportion of transmissions may occur from nonresident adults. The benefits of increased ventilation are maximized when the period of infectivity is reduced by prompt treatment of source cases.",51,1537-6591 (Electronic),401-8,http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/51/4/401.full.pdf,Clin Infect Dis
JOUR,article,1023,The transmission dynamics of tuberculosis in a recently developed chinese city,2010-01-01,"BACKGROUND: Hong Kong is an affluent subtropical city with a well-developed healthcare infrastructure but an intermediate TB burden. Declines in notification rates through the 1960s and 1970s have slowed since the 1980s to the current level of around 82 cases per 100 000 population. We studied the transmission dynamics of TB in Hong Kong to explore the factors underlying recent trends in incidence. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We fitted an age-structured compartmental model to TB notifications in Hong Kong between 1968 and 2008. We used the model to quantify the proportion of annual cases due to recent transmission versus endogenous reactivation of latent infection, and to project trends in incidence rates to 2018. The proportion of annual TB notifications attributed to endogenous reactivation increased from 46% to 70% between 1968 and 2008. Age-standardized notification rates were projected to decline to approximately 56 per 100 000 in 2018. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Continued intermediate incidence of TB in Hong Kong is driven primarily by endogenous reactivation of latent infections. Public health interventions which focus on reducing transmission may not lead to substantial reductions in disease burden associated with endogenous reactivation of latent infections in the short- to medium-term. While reductions in transmission with socio-economic development and public health interventions will lead to declines in TB incidence in these regions, a high prevalence of latent infections may hinder substantial declines in burden in the longer term. These findings may therefore have important implications for the burden of TB in developing regions with higher levels of transmission currently.",5,1932-6203 (Electronic) 1932-6203 (Linking),e10468,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&dopt=Citation&list_uids=20454620,PLoS One

JOUR,article,1029,A dynamic analysis of tuberculosis dissemination to improve control and surveillance,2010-01-01,"BACKGROUND: Detailed analysis of the dynamic interactions among biological, environmental, social, and economic factors that favour the spread of certain diseases is extremely useful for designing effective control strategies. Diseases like tuberculosis that kills somebody every 15 seconds in the world, require methods that take into account the disease dynamics to design truly efficient control and surveillance strategies. The usual and well established statistical approaches provide insights into the cause-effect relationships that favour disease transmission but they only estimate risk areas, spatial or temporal trends. Here we introduce a novel approach that allows figuring out the dynamical behaviour of the disease spreading. This information can subsequently be used to validate mathematical models of the dissemination process from which the underlying mechanisms that are responsible for this spreading could be inferred. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The method presented here is based on the analysis of the spread of tuberculosis in a Brazilian endemic city during five consecutive years. The detailed analysis of the spatio-temporal correlation of the yearly geo-referenced data, using different characteristic times of the disease evolution, allowed us to trace the temporal path of the aetiological agent, to locate the sources of infection, and to characterize the dynamics of disease spreading. Consequently, the method also allowed for the identification of socio-economic factors that influence the process. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The information obtained can contribute to more effective budget allocation, drug distribution and recruitment of human skilled resources, as well as guiding the design of vaccination programs. We propose that this novel strategy can also be applied to the evaluation of other diseases as well as other social processes.",5,1932-6203 (Electronic),e14140,http://www.plosone.org/article/fetchObjectAttachment.action?uri=info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0014140&representation=PDF,PLoS One
JOUR,article,649,Projected effects of tobacco smoking on worldwide tuberculosis control: mathematical modelling analysis,2011-01-01,"OBJECTIVES: Almost 20% of people smoke tobacco worldwide--a percentage projected to rise in many poor countries. Smoking has been linked to increased individual risk of tuberculosis infection and mortality, but it remains unclear how these risks affect population-wide tuberculosis rates. DESIGN: We constructed a state transition, compartmental, mathematical model of tuberculosis epidemics to estimate the impact of alternative future smoking trends on tuberculosis control. We projected tuberculosis incidence, prevalence, and mortality in each World Health Organization region from 2010 to 2050, and incorporated changing trends in smoking, case detection, treatment success, and HIV prevalence. RESULTS: The model predicted that smoking would produce an excess of 18 million tuberculosis cases (standard error 16-20) and 40 million deaths from tuberculosis (39-41) between 2010 and 2050, if smoking trends continued along current trajectories. The effect of smoking was anticipated to increase the number of tuberculosis cases by 7% (274 million v 256 million) and deaths by 66% (101 million v 61 million), compared with model predictions that did not account for smoking. Smoking was also expected to delay the millennium development goal target to reduce tuberculosis mortality by half from 1990 to 2015. The model estimated that aggressive tobacco control (achieving a 1% decrease in smoking prevalence per year down to eradication) would avert 27 million smoking attributable deaths from tuberculosis by 2050. However, if the prevalence of smoking increased to 50% of adults (as observed in countries with high tobacco use), the model estimated that 34 million additional deaths from tuberculosis would occur by 2050. CONCLUSIONS: Tobacco smoking could substantially increase tuberculosis cases and deaths worldwide in coming years, undermining progress towards tuberculosis mortality targets. Aggressive tobacco control could avert millions of deaths from tuberculosis.",343,1756-1833 (Electronic),d5506,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3186817/pdf/bmj.d5506.pdf,BMJ
JOUR,article,552,Addressing institutional amplifiers in the dynamics and control of tuberculosis epidemics,2011-01-01,"Tuberculosis outbreaks originating in prisons, mines, or hospital wards can spread to the larger community. Recent proposals have targeted these high-transmission institutional amplifiers by improving case detection, treatment, or reducing the size of the exposed population. However, what effects these alternative proposals may have is unclear. We mathematically modeled these control strategies and found case detection and treatment methods insufficient in addressing epidemics involving common types of institutional amplifiers. Movement of persons in and out of amplifiers fundamentally altered the transmission dynamics of tuberculosis in a manner not effectively mitigated by detection or treatment alone. Policies increasing the population size exposed to amplifiers or the per-person duration of exposure within amplifiers potentially worsened incidence, even in settings with high rates of detection and treatment success. However, reducing the total population size entering institutional amplifiers significantly lowered tuberculosis incidence and the risk of propagating new drug-resistant tuberculosis strains.",84,1476-1645 (Electronic),30-7,http://www.ajtmh.org/content/84/1/30.full.pdf,Am J Trop Med Hyg
JOUR,article,660,A theoretical assessment of the effects of smoking on the transmission dynamics of tuberculosis,2011-01-01,"Smoking has long being associated with tuberculosis. We present a tuberculosis dynamics model taking into account the fact that some people in the population are smoking in order to assess the effects of smoking on tuberculosis transmission. The epidemic thresholds known as the reproduction numbers and equilibria for the model are determined and stabilities analyzed. Qualitative analysis of the model including positivity and persistence of solutions are presented. The model is numerically analyzed to assess the effects of smoking on the transmission dynamics of tuberculosis. Numerical simulations of the model show that smoking enhances tuberculosis transmission, progression to active disease and in a population of smokers, tuberculosis cannot be controlled even when treatment success is assumed to be as high as 88%. Further, analysis of the reproduction numbers indicates that the number of active tuberculosis cases increases as the number of smokers increase.",73,1522-9602 (Electronic),1333-57,http://www.springerlink.com/content/4n410216p3555249/,Bull Math Biol
JOUR,article,672,Influence of sampling on clustering and associations with risk factors in the molecular epidemiology of tuberculosis,2011-01-01,"Molecular epidemiologic studies may use genotypic clustering of isolates as an indicator of recent transmission. It has been shown that missing cases lead to underestimating clustering, and modelling studies suggested that they may also lead to underestimating odds ratios for clustering. Using a national, comprehensive database from the Netherlands covering 15 years between 1993 and 2007 and including over 12,000 patients and their isolates, the authors determined the effects of sampling at random, in time, and by geographic area. As expected, sampling reduced the observed clustering percentages. However, sampling did not reduce the observed odds ratios for clustering. The main explanations for this discrepancy with model outcomes were that a substantial proportion of clustered cases were found in large clusters and that risk factors for clustering tended to be-among clustered cases-also risk factors for large clusters. The authors conclude that, in settings where risk factors for clustering may be interpreted as risk factors for recent transmission, these risk factors are also associated with larger cluster sizes. As a result, odds ratios would show limited sampling bias.",174,1476-6256 (Electronic),243-51,http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/174/2/243.full.pdf,Am J Epidemiol
JOUR,article,678,"Epidemiologic inference from the distribution of tuberculosis cases in households in Lima, Peru",2011-01-01,"Background. Tuberculosis (TB) often occurs among household contacts of people with active TB. It is unclear whether clustering of cases represents household transmission or shared household risk factors for TB. Methods. We used cross-sectional data from 764 households in Lima, Peru, to estimate the relative contributions of household and community transmission, the average time between cases, and the immunity afforded by a previous TB infection. Results. The distribution of cases per household suggests that almost 7 of 10 nonindex household cases were infected in the community rather than in the household. The average interval between household cases was 3.5 years. We observed a saturation effect in the number of cases per household and estimated that protective immunity conferred up to 35% reduction in the risk of disease. Conclusions. Cross-sectional household data can elucidate the natural history and transmission dynamics of TB. In this high-incidence setting, we found that the majority of cases were attributable to community transmission and that household contacts of case patients derive some immunity from household exposures. Screening of household contacts may be an effective method of detecting new TB cases if carried out over several years.",203,1537-6613 (Electronic) 0022-1899 (Linking),1582-1589,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&dopt=Citation&list_uids=21592987,J Infect Dis
JOUR,article,693,A probabilistic transmission model to assess infection risk from Mycobacterium tuberculosis in commercial passenger trains,2011-01-01,"The objective of this article is to characterize the risk of infection from airborne Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli exposure in commercial passenger trains based on a risk-based probabilistic transmission modeling. We investigated the tuberculosis (TB) infection risks among commercial passengers by inhaled aerosol M. tuberculosis bacilli and quantify the patterns of TB transmission in Taiwan High Speed Rail (THSR). A deterministic Wells-Riley mathematical model was used to account for the probability of infection risk from M. tuberculosis bacilli by linking the cough-generated aerosol M. tuberculosis bacilli concentration and particle size distribution. We found that (i) the quantum generation rate of TB was estimated with a lognormal distribution of geometric mean (GM) of 54.29 and geometric standard deviation (GSD) of 3.05 quantum/h at particle size </= 5 mum and (ii) the basic reproduction numbers (R(0) ) were estimated to be 0.69 (0.06-6.79), 2.82 (0.32-20.97), and 2.31 (0.25-17.69) for business, standard, and nonreserved cabins, respectively. The results indicate that commercial passengers taking standard and nonreserved cabins had higher transmission risk than those in business cabins based on conservatism. Our results also reveal that even a brief exposure, as in the bronchoscopy cases, can also result in a transmission when the quantum generation rate is high. This study could contribute to a better understanding of the dynamics of TB transmission in commercial passenger trains by assessing the relationship between TB infectiousness, passenger mobility, and key model parameters such as seat occupancy, ventilation rate, and exposure duration.",31,1539-6924 (Electronic),930-9,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1539-6924.2010.01552.x/abstract,Risk Anal
JOUR,article,705,Spontaneous emergence of multiple drug resistance in tuberculosis before and during therapy,2011-01-01,"The emergence of drug resistance in M. tuberculosis undermines the efficacy of tuberculosis (TB) treatment in individuals and of TB control programs in populations. Multiple drug resistance is often attributed to sequential functional monotherapy, and standard initial treatment regimens have therefore been designed to include simultaneous use of four different antibiotics. Despite the widespread use of combination therapy, highly resistant M. tb strains have emerged in many settings. Here we use a stochastic birth-death model to estimate the probability of the emergence of multidrug resistance during the growth of a population of initially drug sensitive TB bacilli within an infected host. We find that the probability of the emergence of resistance to the two principal anti-TB drugs before initiation of therapy ranges from 10(-5) to 10(-4); while rare, this is several orders of magnitude higher than previous estimates. This finding suggests that multidrug resistant M. tb may not be an entirely ""man-made"" phenomenon and may help explain how highly drug resistant forms of TB have independently emerged in many settings.",6,1932-6203 (Electronic),e18327,http://www.plosone.org/article/fetchObjectAttachment.action?uri=info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0018327&representation=PDF,PLoS One

JOUR,article,561,Periodic active case finding for TB: when to look?,2011-01-01,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the factors influencing the performance and cost-efficacy of periodic rounds of active case finding (ACF) for TB. METHODS: A mathematical model of TB dynamics and periodic ACF (PACF) in the HIV era, simplified by assuming constant prevalence of latent TB infection, is analyzed for features that control intervention outcome, measured as cases averted and cases found. Explanatory variables include baseline TB incidence, interval between PACF rounds, and different routine and PACF case-detection rates among HIV-infected and uninfected TB cases. FINDINGS: PACF can be cost-saving over a 10 year time frame if the cost-per-round is lower than a threshold proportional to initial incidence and cost-per-case-treated. More cases are averted at higher baseline incidence rates, when more potent PACF strategies are used, intervals between PACF rounds are shorter, and when the ratio of HIV-negative to positive TB cases detected is higher. More costly approaches, e.g. radiographic screening, can be as cost-effective as less costly alternatives if PACF case-detection is higher and/or implementation less frequent. CONCLUSION: Periodic ACF can both improve control and save medium-term health care costs in high TB burden settings. Greater costs of highly effective PACF at frequent (e.g. yearly) intervals may be offset by higher numbers of cases averted in populations with high baseline TB incidence, higher prevalence of HIV-uninfected cases, higher costs per-case-treated, and more effective routine case-detection. Less intensive approaches may still be cost-neutral or cost-saving in populations lacking one or more of these key determinants.",6,1932-6203 (Electronic),e29130,http://www.plosone.org/article/fetchObjectAttachment.action?uri=info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0029130&representation=PDF,PLoS One
JOUR,article,737,Serological testing versus other strategies for diagnosis of active tuberculosis in India: a cost-effectiveness analysis,2011-01-01,"BACKGROUND: Undiagnosed and misdiagnosed tuberculosis (TB) drives the epidemic in India. Serological (antibody detection) TB tests are not recommended by any agency, but widely used in many countries, including the Indian private sector. The cost and impact of using serology compared with other diagnostic techniques is unknown. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Taking a patient cohort conservatively equal to the annual number of serological tests done in India (1.5 million adults suspected of having active TB), we used decision analysis to estimate costs and effectiveness of sputum smear microscopy (US$3.62 for two smears), microscopy plus automated liquid culture (mycobacterium growth indicator tube [MGIT], US$20/test), and serological testing (anda-tb ELISA, US$20/test). Data on test accuracy and costs were obtained from published literature. We adopted the perspective of the Indian TB control sector and an analysis frame of 1 year. Our primary outcome was the incremental cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted. We performed one-way sensitivity analysis on all model parameters, with multiway sensitivity analysis on variables to which the model was most sensitive. If used instead of sputum microscopy, serology generated an estimated 14,000 more TB diagnoses, but also 121,000 more false-positive diagnoses, 102,000 fewer DALYs averted, and 32,000 more secondary TB cases than microscopy, at approximately four times the incremental cost (US$47.5 million versus US$11.9 million). When added to high-quality sputum smears, MGIT culture was estimated to avert 130,000 incremental DALYs at an incremental cost of US$213 per DALY averted. Serology was dominated by (i.e., more costly and less effective than) MGIT culture and remained less economically favorable than sputum smear or TB culture in one-way and multiway sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: In India, sputum smear microscopy remains the most cost-effective diagnostic test available for active TB; efforts to increase access to quality-assured microscopy should take priority. In areas where high-quality microscopy exists and resources are sufficient, MGIT culture is more cost-effective than serology as an additional diagnostic test for TB. These data informed a recently published World Health Organization policy statement against serological tests.",8,1549-1676 (Electronic),e1001074,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21857810,PLoS Med

The Novartis compounds were also filtered with computational SMARTS alerts to identify potentially undesirable substructures. RESULTS: Using the Novartis compounds as a test set for the Bayesian models demonstrated a >4.0-fold enrichment over random screening for finding aerobic hits not in the computational models (N = 34). A 10-fold enrichment was observed for finding Mtb active compounds in the FDA drugs database. 85.9% of the Novartis compounds failed the Abbott SMARTS alerts, a value substantially higher than for known TB drugs. Higher levels of failures of SMARTS filters from different groups also correlate with the number of Lipinski violations.

JOUR,article,755,Potential cost-effectiveness of rifampin vs. isoniazid for latent tuberculosis: implications for future clinical trials,2011-01-01,"SETTING: Standard treatment for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is 9 months daily isoniazid (9INH). An alternative is 4 months daily rifampin (4RMP), associated with better completion and less toxicity; however, its efficacy remains uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of these regimens for treating LTBI in human immunodeficiency virus negative persons, using results from a recent clinical trial, plus different scenarios for 4RMP efficacy, and to estimate the costs of an adequately powered noninferiority trial and resulting savings from substitution with 4RMP. DESIGN: A decision-analysis model tracked TB contacts and lower-risk tuberculin reactors receiving 9INH, 4RMP or no treatment. For different 4RMP efficacy scenarios, we estimated the cost-effectiveness, sample size and cost of non-inferiority trials, and potential cost savings substituting 4RMP for 9INH for 10 years in Canada. RESULTS: With an assumed 4RMP efficacy of 60%, 9INH was more effective but slightly more expensive. Above a threshold efficacy of 69%, 4RMP was cheaper and more effective than 9INH. If the true efficacy of 4RMP is >/=75%, a trial powered to detect non-inferiority with a lower limit of 60% estimated efficacy (~20 000 subjects) may lead to cost savings within 10 years, even with the extreme assumption that Canada bears the entire cost. CONCLUSION: 4RMP may be a reasonable alternative to 9INH. Costs of a large-scale non-inferiority trial may be offset by subsequent savings.",15,1815-7920 (Electronic),1340-6,NA,International Journal of Tuberculosis and Lung Disease

One such factor is TNF-alpha. TNF-alpha has been experimentally characterized to have the following activities in M. tuberculosis infection: macrophage activation, apoptosis, and chemokine and cytokine production. Availability of TNF-alpha within a granuloma has been proposed to play a critical role in immunity to M. tuberculosis. However, in vivo measurement of a TNF-alpha concentration gradient and activities within a granuloma are not experimentally feasible. Further, processes that control TNF-alpha concentration and activities in a granuloma remain unknown. We developed a multiscale computational model that includes molecular, cellular, and tissue scale events that occur during granuloma formation and maintenance in lung. We use our model to identify processes that regulate TNF-alpha concentration and cellular behaviors and thus influence the outcome of infection within a granuloma. Our model predicts that TNF-alphaR1 internalization kinetics play a critical role in infection control within a granuloma, controlling whether there is clearance of bacteria, excessive inflammation, containment of bacteria within a stable granuloma, or uncontrolled growth of bacteria. Our results suggest that there is an interplay between TNF-alpha and bacterial levels in a granuloma that is controlled by the combined effects of both molecular and cellular scale processes.

JOUR,article,778,Rule-based modelling of iron homeostasis in tuberculosis,2011-01-01,"To establish itself within the host system, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) has formulated various means of attacking the host system. One such crucial strategy is the exploitation of the iron resources of the host system. Obtaining and maintaining the required concentration of iron becomes a matter of contest between the host and the pathogen, both trying to achieve this through complex molecular networks. The extent of complexity makes it important to obtain a systems perspective of the interplay between the host and the pathogen with respect to iron homeostasis. We have reconstructed a systems model comprising 92 components and 85 protein-protein or protein-metabolite interactions, which have been captured as a set of 194 rules. Apart from the interactions, these rules also account for protein synthesis and decay, RBC circulation and bacterial production and death rates. We have used a rule-based modelling approach, Kappa, to simulate the system separately under infection and non-infection conditions. Various perturbations including knock-outs and dual perturbation were also carried out to monitor the behavioral change of important proteins and metabolites. From this, key components as well as the required controlling factors in the model that are critical for maintaining iron homeostasis were identified. The model is able to re-establish the importance of iron-dependent regulator (ideR) in Mtb and transferrin (Tf) in the host. Perturbations, where iron storage is increased, appear to enhance nutritional immunity and the analysis indicates how they can be harmful for the host. Instead, decreasing the rate of iron uptake by Tf may prove to be helpful. Simulation and perturbation studies help in identifying Tf as a possible drug target. Regulating the mycobactin (myB) concentration was also identified as a possible strategy to control bacterial growth. The simulations thus provide significant insight into iron homeostasis and also for identifying possible drug targets for tuberculosis.",7,1742-2051 (Electronic),2750-68,http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2011/MB/c1mb05093a,Mol Biosyst
JOUR,article,787,A cost-benefit analysis of scaling up tuberculosis control in India,2011-01-01,"OBJECTIVES: To measure the economic costs and benefits of scaling up tuberculosis (TB) control under the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP) in India. DESIGN: Modelling based on country-level programme and epidemiological data from 1997 to 2006. RESULTS: The scale-up of TB control in India has resulted in a total health benefit of 29.2 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), including 1.3 million deaths averted. In 2006, the burden of TB measured in terms of DALYs lost would have been 1.8 times higher in the absence of the programme. The total gain in economic well-being from TB control is estimated at US$88.1 billion over the 1997-2006 10-year period. Total public expenditure on TB control over this period amounted to US$768 million, with the RNTCP accounting for US$299 million and other health sector costs accounting for US$469 million. The cost of TB control averaged just US$26 per DALY gained over 1997-2006 and generated a return of US$115 per dollar spent. CONCLUSIONS: The scale-up of TB control has been a very cost-effective strategy for improving the health status of India's population, while the return on investment has been exceptional from a societal perspective.",15,1815-7920 (Electronic),358-62,NA,International Journal of Tuberculosis and Lung Disease

Current in vitro models of TB, while valuable, are poor predictors of the antibacterial effect of drugs in vivo. Mathematical models may be useful to overcome the limitations of traditional approaches in TB research. The objective of this study was to set up a prototype mathematical model of TB treatment by rifampin, based on pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and disease submodels. The full mathematical model can simulate the time-course of tuberculous disease from the first day of infection to the last day of therapy. Therapeutic simulations were performed with the full model to study the antibacterial effect of various dosage regimens of rifampin in lungs. The model reproduced some qualitative and quantitative properties of the bactericidal activity of rifampin observed in clinical data. The kill curves simulated with the model showed a typical biphasic decline in the number of extracellular bacteria consistent with observations in TB patients. Simulations performed with more simple pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic models indicated a possible role of a protected intracellular bacterial compartment in such a biphasic decline. This modeling effort strongly suggests that current dosage regimens of RIF may be further optimized.

JOUR,article,796,Modeling socio-demography to capture tuberculosis transmission dynamics in a low burden setting,2011-01-01,"Evidence of preferential mixing through selected social routes has been suggested for the transmission of tuberculosis (TB) infection in low burden settings. A realistic modelization of these contact routes is needed to appropriately assess the impact of individually targeted control strategies, such as contact network investigation of index cases and treatment of latent TB infection (LTBI). We propose an age-structured, socio-demographic individual based model (IBM) with a realistic, time-evolving structure of preferential contacts in a population. In particular, transmission within households, schools and workplaces, together with a component of casual, distance-dependent contacts are considered. We also compared the model against two other formulations having no social structure of contacts (homogeneous mixing transmission): a baseline deterministic model without age structure and an age-structured IBM. The socio-demographic IBM better fitted recent longitudinal data on TB epidemiology in Arkansas, USA, which serves as an example of a low burden setting. Inclusion of age structure in the model proved fundamental to capturing actual proportions of reactivated TB cases (as opposed to recently transmitted) as well as profiling age-group specific incidence. The socio-demographic structure additionally provides a prediction of TB transmission rates (the rate of infection in household contacts and the rate of secondary cases in household and workplace contacts). These results suggest that the socio-demographic IBM is an optimal choice for evaluating current control strategies, including contact network investigation of index cases, and the simulation of alternative scenarios, particularly for TB eradication targets.",289,1095-8541 (Electronic),197-205,http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0022519311004358/1-s2.0-S0022519311004358-main.pdf?_tid=51cf6280baf7343d83850525bdaed5d3&acdnat=1345012454_66e6a3a6ba3270670d4232cc72803123,J Theor Biol
JOUR,article,812,Bayesian methods for fitting mixture models that characterize branching tree processes: An application to development of resistant TB strains,2011-01-01,"For pathogens that must be treated with combinations of antibiotics and acquire resistance through genetic mutation, knowledge of the order in which drug-resistance mutations occur may be important for determining treatment policies. Diagnostic specimens collected from patients are often available; this makes it possible to determine the presence of individual drug resistance-conferring mutations and combinations of these mutations. In most cases, these specimens are only available from a patient at a single point in time; it is very rare to have access to multiple specimens from a single patient collected over time as resistance accumulates to multiple drugs. Statistical methods that use branching trees have been successfully applied to such cross-sectional data to make inference on the ordering of events that occurred prior to sampling. Here, we propose a Bayesian approach to fitting branching tree models that has several advantages, including the ability to accommodate prior information regarding measurement error or cross resistance and the natural way it permits the characterization of uncertainty. Our methods are applied to a data set for drug-resistant TB in Peru; the goal of the analysis was to determine the order with which patients develop resistance to the drugs commonly used for treating TB in this setting.",30,1097-0258 (Electronic),2708-20,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ez.lshtm.ac.uk/store/10.1002/sim.4287/asset/sim4287.pdf?v=1&t=h5w1m62j&s=09334abd6f823c09c5f187f158f8e5341cba1933,Stat Med
JOUR,article,815,A Mathematical model for evaluating tuberculosis screening strategies,2011-01-01,"In order to better predict epidemic of tuberculosis (TB) and evaluate the effect of TB control strategies, we added the effect of transmission from permanent residents to migrants to our previous TB model. We simulated the behavior of TB transmission by the extended model. The numerical simulation indicated that the basic reproductive numbers must be less than one in both permanent residents and migrants in order to eliminate the disease from total population. We also evaluated the Canada's TB screening strategy and observe that TB is sensitive to the strategy. Our study suggests that immigrants have a considerable influence on the overall transmission dynamics behavior of tuberculosis.

JOUR,article,818,Tuberculosis in a South African prison - a transmission modelling analysis,2011-01-01,"BACKGROUND: Prisons are recognised internationally as institutions with very high tuberculosis (TB) burdens where transmission is predominantly determined by contact between infectious and susceptible prisoners. A recent South African court case described the conditions under which prisoners awaiting trial were kept. With the use of these data, a mathematical model was developed to explore the interactions between incarceration conditions and TB control measures. METHODS: Cell dimensions, cell occupancy, lock-up time, TB incidence and treatment delays were derived from court evidence and judicial reports. Using the Wells-Riley equation and probability analyses of contact between prisoners, we estimated the current TB transmission probability within prison cells, and estimated transmission probabilities of improved levels of case finding in combination with implementation of national and international minimum standards for incarceration. RESULTS: Levels of overcrowding (230%) in communal cells and poor TB case finding result in annual TB transmission risks of 90% per annum. Implementing current national or international cell occupancy recommendations would reduce TB transmission probabilities by 30% and 50%, respectively. Improved passive case finding, modest ventilation increase or decreased lock-up time would minimally impact on transmission if introduced individually. However, active case finding together with implementation of minimum national and international standards of incarceration could reduce transmission by 50% and 94%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Current conditions of detention for awaiting-trial prisoners are highly conducive for spread of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant TB. Combinations of simple well-established scientific control measures should be implemented urgently.",101,0256-9574 (Print),809-13,NA,S Afr Med J
JOUR,article,827,Cost-effectiveness of interferon-gamma release assay versus chest X-ray for tuberculosis screening of employees,2011-01-01,"BACKGROUND: Currently, an annual chest X-ray examination (CXR) for detection of active tuberculosis (TB) in employees aged >/=40 years is recommended in the guidelines of the Japan Industrial Safety and Health Law. Interferon-gamma release assays are new alternatives to the tuberculin skin test for detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, with higher specificity than the tuberculin skin test and without cross-reactivity with the Bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccine. This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of employee TB screening using QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT) versus CXR. METHODS: Markov models were constructed. The target population was a hypothetical cohort of immunocompetent 40-year-old individuals, using a societal perspective and a lifetime horizon. All costs and clinical benefits were discounted at a fixed annual rate of 3%. RESULTS: In a base-case analysis, the QFT strategy was the most cost-effective ($US 262.84; 22.87049 quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]) compared with no screening ($448.38; 22.85452 QALYs) and CXR ($543.50; 22.85453 QALYs) [year 2009 values].

JOUR,article,838,A Probabilistic Transmission and Population Dynamic Model to Assess Tuberculosis Infection Risk,2011-01-01,"The purpose of this study was to examine tuberculosis (TB) population dynamics and to assess potential infection risk in Taiwan. A well-established mathematical model of TB transmission built on previous models was adopted to study the potential impact of TB transmission. A probabilistic risk model was also developed to estimate site-specific risks of developing disease soon after recent primary infection, exogenous reinfection, or through endogenous reactivation (latently infected TB) among Taiwan regions. Here, we showed that the proportion of endogenous reactivation (53-67%) was larger than that of exogenous reinfection (32-47%). Our simulations showed that as epidemic reaches a steady state, age distribution of cases would finally shift toward older age groups dominated by latently infected TB cases as a result of endogenous reactivation. A comparison of age-weighted TB incidence data with our model simulation output with 95% credible intervals revealed that the predictions were in an apparent agreement with observed data. The median value of overall basic reproduction number (R(0) ) in eastern Taiwan ranged from 1.65 to 1.72, whereas northern Taiwan had the lowest R(0) estimate of 1.50. We found that total TB incidences in eastern Taiwan had 25-27% probabilities of total proportion of infected population exceeding 90%, whereas there were 36-66% probabilities having exceeded 20% of total proportion of infected population attributed to latently infected TB. We suggested that our Taiwan-based analysis can be extended to the context of developing countries, where TB remains a substantial cause of elderly morbidity and mortality.",NA,1539-6924 (Electronic),NA,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1539-6924.2011.01750.x/abstract,Risk Anal
JOUR,article,577,A modelling framework to support the selection and implementation of new tuberculosis diagnostic tools,2011-01-01,"Efforts to stimulate technological innovation in the diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) have resulted in the recent introduction of several novel diagnostic tools. As these products come to market, policy makers must make difficult decisions about which of the available tools to implement. This choice should depend not only on the test characteristics (e.g., sensitivity and specificity) of the tools, but also on how they will be used within the existing health care infrastructure. Accordingly, policy makers choosing between diagnostic strategies must decide: 1) What is the best combination of tools to select? 2)Who should be tested with the new tools? and 3)Will these tools complement or replace existing diagnostics? The best choice of diagnostic strategy will likely vary between settings with different epidemiology (e.g., levels of TB incidence, human immunodeficiency virus co-infection and drug-resistant TB) and structural and resource constraints (e.g., existing diagnostic pathways, human resources and laboratory capacity). We propose a joint modelling framework that includes a tuberculosis (TB) transmission component (a dynamic epidemiological model) and a health system component (an operational systems model) to support diagnostic strategy decisions. This modelling approach captures the complex feedback loops in this system: new diagnostic strategies alter the demands on and performance of health systems that impact TB transmission dynamics which, in turn, result in further changes to demands on the health system. We demonstrate the use of a simplified model to support the rational choice of a diagnostic strategy based on health systems requirements, patient outcomes and population-level TB impact.",15,1815-7920 (Electronic),996-1004,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21740663,International Journal of Tuberculosis and Lung Disease
JOUR,article,844,Priorities for screening and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection in the United States,2011-01-01,"RATIONALE: To improve the effectiveness of tuberculosis (TB) control programs in the United States by identifying cost-effective priorities for screening for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). OBJECTIVES: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of LTBI screening using the tuberculin skin test (TST)and interferon-g release assays (IGRAs). METHODS: A Markov model of screening for LTBI with TST and IGRA in risk-groups considered in current LTBI screening guidelines. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In all risk-groups, TST and IGRA screening resulted in increased mean life expectancy, ranging from 0.03-0.24 life-months per person screened. IGRA screening resulted in greater life expectancy gains than TST. Screening always cost more than not screening, but IGRA was cost-saving compared with TST in some groups. Four patterns of cost-effectiveness emerged, related to four risk categories. (1) Individuals at highest risk of TB reactivation (close contacts and those infected with HIV): the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of IGRA compared with TST was less than $100,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. (2) The foreign-born: IGRA was cost-saving compared with TST and cost-effective compared with no screening (ICER ,$100,000 per QALY gained). (3) Vulnerable populations (e.g., homeless, drug user, or former prisoner): the ICER of TST screening was approximately $100,000-$150,000 per QALY gained, but IGRA was not cost-effective. (4) Medical comorbidities (e.g., diabetes): the ICER of screening with TST or IGRA was greater than $100,000 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: LTBI screening guidelines could make progress toward TB elimination by prioritizing screening for close contacts, those infected with HIV, and the foreign-born regardless of time living in the United States.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the cost-effectiveness of universal vs. targeted and sequential testing strategies and the use of tuberculin skin testing (TST) vs. IGRAs. DESIGN: Using a decision-analytic model, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated in 2009 among nine potential strategies for screening recruits. A societal perspective was taken over a 20-year analytic horizon, discounting future costs at 3% annually. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to determine how changes in assumptions affected the estimates. RESULTS: Targeted strategies cost over US$250 000 per case prevented, whereas universal testing strategies cost over US$700 000 per incremental case prevented in base case and most sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION: Targeted testing offered the best value in this population, although it was still relatively expensive compared to no testing. Sequential testing with both TST and IGRAs provided a poor incremental value compared to targeted and universal testing strategies. Targeted testing using TST was slightly more cost-effective than targeted testing using either QuantiFERON(R)-TB Gold In-Tube or T-SPOT(R).TB, but these estimates were very sensitive to changes in model assumptions.",15,1815-7920; 1027-3719,"1223-30, i",NA,International Journal of Tuberculosis and Lung Disease

JOUR,article,587,Modelling the performance of isoniazid preventive therapy for reducing tuberculosis in HIV endemic settings: the effects of network structure,2011-01-01,"Individuals living with HIV experience a much higher risk of progression from latent M. tuberculosis infection to active tuberculosis (TB) disease relative to individuals with intact immune systems. A several-month daily course of a single drug during latent infection (i.e. isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT)) has proved in clinical trials to substantially reduce an HIV-infected individual's risk of TB disease. As a result of these findings and ongoing studies, the World Health Organization has produced strong guidelines for implementing IPT on a community-wide scale for individuals with HIV at risk of TB disease. To date, there has been limited use of IPT at a community-wide level. In this paper, we present a new co-network model for HIV and TB co-epidemics to address questions about how the population-level impact of community-wide IPT may differ from the individual-level impact of IPT offered to selected individuals. In particular, we examine how the effect of clustering of contacts within high-TB incidence communities may affect the rates of re-infection with TB and how this clustering modifies the expected population-level effects of IPT. We find that populations with clustering of respiratory contacts experience aggregation of TB cases and high numbers of re-infection events. While, encouragingly, the overall population-level effects of community-wide IPT appear to be sustained regardless of network structure, we find that in populations where these contacts are highly clustered, there is dramatic heterogeneity in the impact of IPT: in some sub-regions of these populations, TB is nearly eliminated, while in others, repeated re-infection almost completely undermines the effect of IPT. Our findings imply that as IPT programmes are brought to scale, we should expect local heterogeneity of effectiveness as a result of the complex patterns of disease transmission within communities.",8,1742-5662 (Electronic),1510-20,http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org.ez.lshtm.ac.uk/content/8/63/1510.full.pdf,J R Soc Interface

Here, we summarize evidence linking social, economic and biologic determinants to tuberculosis (TB) and review modeling approaches that have been used to understand their contribution to the epidemic dynamics of TB. Specifically, we find evidence for associations between smoking, indoor air pollution, diabetes mellitus, alcohol, nutritional status, crowding, migration, aging and economic trends, and the occurrence of TB infection and/or disease. We outline some methodological problems inherent to the study of these associations; these include study design issues, reverse causality and misclassification of both exposure and outcomes. We then go on to review two existing approaches to modeling the impact of determinants and the effect of interventions: the population attributable fraction model, which estimates the proportion of the TB burden that would be averted if exposure to a risk factor were eliminated from the population, and deterministic epidemic models that capture transmission dynamics and the indirect effects of interventions. We conclude by defining research priorities in both the study of specific determinants and the development of appropriate models to assess the impact of addressing these determinants.",15 Suppl 2,1815-7920 (Electronic),S64-70,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21740661,International Journal of Tuberculosis and Lung Disease

JOUR,article,902,Developing a Tuberculosis Transmission Model That Accounts for Changes in Population Health,2011-01-01,"Background. Simulation models are useful in policy planning for tuberculosis (TB) control. To accurately assess interventions, important modifiers of the epidemic should be accounted for in evaluative models. Improvements in population health were associated with the declining TB epidemic in the pre–antibiotic era and may be relevant today. The objective of this study was to develop and validate a TB transmission model that accounted for changes in population health. Methods. We developed a deterministic TB transmission model, using reported data from the pre–antibiotic era in England. Change in adjusted life expectancy, used as a proxy for general health, was used to determine the rate of change of key epidemiological parameters. Predicted outcomes included risk of TB infection and TB mortality. The model was validated in the setting of the Netherlands and then applied to modern Peru. Results. The model, developed in the setting of England, predicted TB trends in the Netherlands very accurately. The R2 value for correlation between observed and predicted data was 0.97 and 0.95 for TB infection and mortality, respectively. In Peru, the predicted decline in incidence prior to the expansion of “Directly Observed Treatment Short Course” (The DOTS strategy) was 3.7% per year (observed = 3.9% per year). After DOTS expansion, the predicted decline was very similar to the observed decline of 5.8% per year. Conclusions. We successfully developed and validated a TB model, which uses a proxy for population health to estimate changes in key epidemiology parameters. Population health contributed significantly to improvement in TB outcomes observed in Peru. Changing population health should be incorporated into evaluative models for global TB control.",31,NA,53-68,http://mdm.sagepub.com/content/31/1/53.abstract,Medical Decision Making
JOUR,article,593,An investigation into the statistical properties of TB episodes in a South African community with high HIV prevalence,2011-01-01,"Continuous differential equations are often applied to small populations with little time spent on understanding uncertainty brought about by small-population effects. Despite large numbers of individuals being latently infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB), progression from latent infection to observable disease is a relatively rare event. For small communities, this means case counts are subject to stochasticity, and deterministic models may not be appropriate tools for interpreting transmission trends. Furthermore, the nonlinear nature of the underlying dynamics means that fluctuations are autocorrelated, which can invalidate standard statistical analyses which assume independent fluctuations. Here we extend recent work using a system of differential equations to study the HIV-TB epidemic in Masiphumelele, a community near Cape Town in South Africa [Bacaer, et al., J. Mol.

Symptom screening alone may be insufficient to exclude TB disease in PLWH because some PLWH with TB disease have no symptoms. The addition of chest radiography (CXR) may improve disease detection. OBJECTIVES: The objective of the present analysis was to compare the costs and effects of the addition of CXR to the symptom screening process against the costs and effects of symptom screening alone. METHODS: Using data from Botswana, a decision analytic model was used to compare a ""Symptom only"" policy against a ""Symptom+CXR"" policy. The outcomes of interest were cost, death, and isoniazid- and multidrug-resistant TB in a hypothetical cohort of 10,000 PLWH. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The Symptom+CXR policy prevented 16 isoniazid- and 0.3 multidrug-resistant TB cases; however, because of attrition from the screening process, there were 98 excess cases of TB, 15 excess deaths, and an additional cost of U.S. $127,100. The Symptom+CXR policy reduced deaths only if attrition was close to zero; however, to eliminate attrition the cost would be U.S. $2.8 million per death averted.

JOUR,article,952,Models to understand the population-level impact of mixed strain M. tuberculosis infections,2011-01-01,"Over the past decade, numerous studies have identified tuberculosis patients in whom more than one distinct strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is present. While it has been shown that these mixed strain infections can reduce the probability of treatment success for individuals simultaneously harboring both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains, it is not yet known if and how this phenomenon impacts the long-term dynamics for tuberculosis within communities. Strain-specific differences in immunogenicity and associations with drug resistance suggest that a better understanding of how strains compete within hosts will be necessary to project the effects of mixed strain infections on the future burden of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant tuberculosis. In this paper, we develop a modeling framework that allows us to investigate mechanisms of strain competition within hosts and to assess the long-term effects of such competition on the ecology of strains in a population. These models permit us to systematically evaluate the importance of unknown parameters and to suggest priority areas for future experimental research. Despite the current scarcity of data to inform the values of several model parameters, we are able to draw important qualitative conclusions from this work. We find that mixed strain infections may promote the coexistence of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains in two ways. First, mixed strain infections allow a strain with a lower basic reproductive number to persist in a population where it would otherwise be outcompeted if has competitive advantages within a co-infected host. Second, some individuals progressing to phenotypically drug-sensitive tuberculosis from a state of mixed drug-sensitive and drug-resistant infection may retain small subpopulations of drug-resistant bacteria that can flourish once the host is treated with antibiotics. We propose that these types of mixed infections, by increasing the ability of low fitness drug-resistant strains to persist, may provide opportunities for compensatory mutations to accumulate and for relatively fit, highly drug-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis to emerge.",280,1095-8541 (Electronic),88-100,http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0022519311002013/1-s2.0-S0022519311002013-main.pdf?_tid=7405d287e36e3e8cfc4ef3bd852a7036&acdnat=1345013619_4d9c2e52fd4fdd0ba38795899948628b,J Theor Biol

The level of nonadherence associated with emergence of MDR-tuberculosis is unknown. Performance of a randomized controlled trial in which some patients are randomized to nonadherence would be unethical; therefore, other study designs should be utilized. METHODS: We performed hollow fiber studies for both bactericidal and sterilizing effect, with inoculum spiked with 0.5% rifampin- and isoniazid-resistant isogenic strains in some experiments. Standard therapy was administered daily for 28-56 days, with extents of nonadherence varying between 0% and 100%. Sizes of drug-resistant populations were compared using analysis of variance. We also explored the effect of pharmacokinetic variability on MDR-tuberculosis emergence using computer-aided clinical trial simulations of 10 000 Cape Town, South Africa, tuberculosis patients. RESULTS: Therapy failure was only encountered at extents of nonadherence >/=60%. Surprisingly, isoniazid- and rifampin-resistant populations did not achieve >/=1% proportion in any experiment and did not achieve a higher proportion with nonadherence. However, clinical trial simulations demonstrated that approximately 1% of tuberculosis patients with perfect adherence would still develop MDR-tuberculosis due to pharmacokinetic variability alone.

JOUR,article,606,Cost-effectiveness of novel vaccines for tuberculosis control: a decision analysis study,2011-01-01,"BACKGROUND: The development of a successful new tuberculosis (TB) vaccine would circumvent many limitations of current diagnostic and treatment practices. However, vaccine development is complex and costly. We aimed to assess the potential cost effectiveness of novel vaccines for TB control in a sub-Saharan African country--Zambia--relative to the existing strategy of directly observed treatment, short course (DOTS) and current level of bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination coverage. METHODS: We conducted a decision analysis model-based simulation from the societal perspective, with a 3% discount rate and all costs expressed in 2007 US dollars. Health outcomes and costs were projected over a 30-year period, for persons born in Zambia (population 11,478,000 in 2005) in year 1. Initial development costs for single vaccination and prime-boost strategies were prorated to the Zambian share (0.398%) of global BCG vaccine coverage for newborns. Main outcome measures were TB-related morbidity, mortality, and costs over a range of potential scenarios for vaccine efficacy. RESULTS: Relative to the status quo strategy, a BCG replacement vaccine administered at birth, with 70% efficacy in preventing rapid progression to TB disease after initial infection, is estimated to avert 932 TB cases and 422 TB-related deaths (prevention of 199 cases/100,000 vaccinated, and 90 deaths/100,000 vaccinated). This would result in estimated net savings of $3.6 million over 30 years for 468,073 Zambians born in year 1 of the simulation. The addition of a booster at age 10 results in estimated savings of $5.6 million compared to the status quo, averting 1,863 TB cases and 1,011 TB-related deaths (prevention of 398 cases/100,000 vaccinated, and of 216 deaths/100,000 vaccinated). With vaccination at birth alone, net savings would be realized within 1 year, whereas the prime-boost strategy would require an additional 5 years to realize savings, reflecting a greater initial development cost. CONCLUSIONS: Investment in an improved TB vaccine is predicted to result in considerable cost savings, as well as a reduction in TB morbidity and TB-related mortality, when added to existing control strategies. For a vaccine with waning efficacy, a prime-boost strategy is more cost-effective in the long term.",11,1471-2458 (Electronic),55,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21269503,BMC Public Health

METHODS: In areas where tuberculosis is endemic, poorly ventilated social gathering places such as shebeens (informal alcohol drinking places), minibus taxis, and clinic waiting rooms are all potential transmission hot spots. We modeled the transmission reduction achieved by removal of infectious persons in settings with different tuberculosis prevalence rates to demonstrate the concept of transmission elasticity. We then applied this concept to real-life data from a hyperendemic community in Cape Town, South Africa. RESULTS: In a hyperendemic area, reducing the number of infectious people by a given percentage results in a smaller percentage decrease in the annual risk of infection (ARI) compared with a nonendemic area; for example, removing 10% of infectious persons could result in as little as a 5% reduction in the ARI. With use of real-life data and removal of 60% of infectious individuals with tuberculosis, as would be achieved by meeting current performance targets of 70% case detection and 85% cure, the estimated ARI reduction is 50%. CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between the number of infectious people removed and the decrease in ARI is nonlinear. The concept of transmission elasticity has important implications for the formulation of universal performance targets, since hyperendemic areas would require more stringent targets to achieve comparable transmission reduction.",52,1537-6591 (Electronic),1399-404,http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/52/12/1399.full.pdf,Clin Infect Dis
JOUR,article,608,Rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis with the Xpert MTB/RIF assay in high burden countries: a cost-effectiveness analysis,2011-01-01,"BACKGROUND: Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) is a promising new rapid diagnostic technology for tuberculosis (TB) that has characteristics that suggest large-scale roll-out. However, because the test is expensive, there are concerns among TB program managers and policy makers regarding its affordability for low- and middle-income settings. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We estimate the impact of the introduction of Xpert on the costs and cost-effectiveness of TB care using decision analytic modelling, comparing the introduction of Xpert to a base case of smear microscopy and clinical diagnosis in India, South Africa, and Uganda. The introduction of Xpert increases TB case finding in all three settings; from 72%-85% to 95%-99% of the cohort of individuals with suspected TB, compared to the base case. Diagnostic costs (including the costs of testing all individuals with suspected TB) also increase: from US$28-US$49 to US$133-US$146 and US$137-US$151 per TB case detected when Xpert is used ""in addition to"" and ""as a replacement of"" smear microscopy, respectively. The incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for using Xpert ""in addition to"" smear microscopy, compared to the base case, range from US$41-$110 per disability adjusted life year (DALY) averted. Likewise the ICERS for using Xpert ""as a replacement of"" smear microscopy range from US$52-$138 per DALY averted. These ICERs are below the World Health Organization (WHO) willingness to pay threshold. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that Xpert is a cost-effective method of TB diagnosis, compared to a base case of smear microscopy and clinical diagnosis of smear-negative TB in low- and middle-income settings where, with its ability to substantially increase case finding, it has important potential for improving TB diagnosis and control. The extent of cost-effectiveness gain to TB programmes from deploying Xpert is primarily dependent on current TB diagnostic practices. Further work is required during scale-up to validate these findings.",8,1549-1676 (Electronic),e1001120,http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/fetchObjectAttachment.action?uri=info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.1001120&representation=PDF,PLoS Med
JOUR,article,1013,A dynamic model for tuberculosis transmission and optimal treatment strategies in South Korea,2011-01-01,"We have developed a dynamic model for tuberculosis (TB) transmission in South Korea using a SEIR model with the time-dependent parameters. South Korea ranked the highest TB incidence among members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in 2005 yr. The observed data from the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) shows a certain rise of active-TB incidence individuals after 2001 yr. Because of this sudden jump, we have considered two different periods for best fitting the model: prior to 2001 yr and posterior to 2001 yr. The least-squares fitting has been used for estimating model parameters to the observed data of active-TB incidence. Our model agrees well with the observed data. In this work, we also propose optimal treatment strategies of TB model in South Korea for the future. We have considered three control mechanisms representing distancing, case finding and case holding efforts.

JOUR,article,615,A Model-Based Bayesian Estimation of the Rate of Evolution of VNTR Loci in Mycobacterium tuberculosis,2012-01-01,"Variable numbers of tandem repeats (VNTR) typing is widely used for studying the bacterial cause of tuberculosis. Knowledge of the rate of mutation of VNTR loci facilitates the study of the evolution and epidemiology of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Previous studies have applied population genetic models to estimate the mutation rate, leading to estimates varying widely from around [Formula: see text] to [Formula: see text] per locus per year. Resolving this issue using more detailed models and statistical methods would lead to improved inference in the molecular epidemiology of tuberculosis. Here, we use a model-based approach that incorporates two alternative forms of a stepwise mutation process for VNTR evolution within an epidemiological model of disease transmission. Using this model in a Bayesian framework we estimate the mutation rate of VNTR in M. tuberculosis from four published data sets of VNTR profiles from Albania, Iran, Morocco and Venezuela. In the first variant, the mutation rate increases linearly with respect to repeat numbers (linear model); in the second, the mutation rate is constant across repeat numbers (constant model). We find that under the constant model, the mean mutation rate per locus is [Formula: see text] (95% CI: [Formula: see text],[Formula: see text])and under the linear model, the mean mutation rate per locus per repeat unit is [Formula: see text] (95% CI: [Formula: see text],[Formula: see text]). These new estimates represent a high rate of mutation at VNTR loci compared to previous estimates. To compare the two models we use posterior predictive checks to ascertain which of the two models is better able to reproduce the observed data. From this procedure we find that the linear model performs better than the constant model. The general framework we use allows the possibility of extending the analysis to more complex models in the future.",8,1553-7358 (Electronic),e1002573,http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/fetchObjectAttachment.action?uri=info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1002573&representation=PDF,PLoS Comput Biol
JOUR,article,540,Cost-Effectiveness of Tuberculosis Diagnostic Strategies to Reduce Early Mortality Among Persons With Advanced HIV Infection Initiating Antiretroviral Therapy,2012-01-01,"Background: In sub-Saharan Africa, patients with advanced HIV experience high mortality during the first few months of antiretroviral therapy (ART), largely attributable to tuberculosis (TB). We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of TB diagnostic strategies to reduce this early mortality. Methods: We developed a decision analytic model to estimate the incremental cost, deaths averted, and cost-effectiveness of 3 TB diagnostic algorithms. The model base case represents current practice (symptoms screening, sputum smear, and chest radiography) in many resource-limited countries in sub-Saharan Africa. We compared the current practice with World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended practice with culture and WHO-recommended practice with the Xpert mycobacterium tuberculosis and resistance to rifampicin test and considered relevant medical costs from a health system perspective using the timeframe of the first 6 months of ART. We conducted univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses on all parameters in the model. Results: When considering TB diagnosis and treatment and ART costs, the cost per patient was $850 for current practice, $809 for the algorithm with Xpert test, and $879 for the algorithm with culture. Our results showed that both WHO-recommended algorithms avert more deaths among TB cases than does the current practice. The algorithm with Xpert test was least costly at reducing early mortality compared with the current practice. Sensitivity analyses indicated that cost-effectiveness findings were stable. Conclusions: Our analysis showed that culture or Xpert were cost-effective at reducing early mortality during the first 6 months of ART compared with the current practice. Thus, our findings provide support for ongoing efforts to expand TB diagnostic capacity.",60,1525-4135,e1-e7 10.1097/QAI.0b013e318246538f,http://journals.lww.com/jaids/Fulltext/2012/05010/Cost_Effectiveness_of_Tuberculosis_Diagnostic.16.aspx,JAIDS Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes
JOUR,article,625,Tuberculosis seasonality in the Netherlands differs between natives and non-natives: a role for vitamin D deficiency?,2012-01-01,"SETTING: The seasonality of tuberculosis (TB) incidence suggests that the risk of infection or development of disease has a seasonal component.OBJECTIVE: To investigate factors associated with seasonal patterns of TB disease in the Netherlands by splitting notifications according to origin (natives vs. non-natives) and disease site (pulmonary TB [PTB] vs. extra-pulmonary TB [EPTB]). We focus on the presence of a seasonal peak, as much debate has centred on factors enhancing transmission vs. disease development.DESIGN: Monthly notifications were derived from culture sample dates of all cases between 1993 and 2008. We fitted seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) models to the time series. Seasonal decomposition revealed seasonal trends. To assess the seasonality of the peak, we repeated the analysis omitting December (trough) notifications.RESULTS: TB notifications show a seasonal pattern, with a peak in spring and a trough in winter, which is present in both PTB and EPTB and in both natives and non-natives. However, when excluding December notifications, seasonality only holds in non-native EPTB and non-native TB notifications.CONCLUSION: A seasonal peak in TB notifications (March-June) is apparent in non-natives, but is absent in natives. This peak is driven by the seasonality of EPTB notifications, which are highest in June-July. The contribution of winter crowding is discussed. Vitamin D deficiency, enhancing disease development at the end of winter-early spring, seems the most likely factor explaining the yearly peak in EPTB.",NA,1815-7920 (Electronic) 1027-3719 (Linking),NA,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&dopt=Citation&list_uids=22410705,International Journal of Tuberculosis and Lung Disease
JOUR,article,541,The cost-effectiveness of routine tuberculosis screening with Xpert MTB/RIF prior to initiation of antiretroviral therapy: a model-based analysis,2012-01-01,"Background: In settings with high tuberculosis (TB) prevalence, 15–30% of HIV-infected individuals initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) have undiagnosed TB. Such patients are usually screened by symptoms and sputum smear, which have poor sensitivity. Objective: To project the clinical and economic outcomes of using Xpert MTB/RIF(Xpert), a rapid TB/rifampicin-resistance diagnostic, to screen individuals initiating ART. Design: We used a microsimulation model to evaluate the clinical impact and cost-effectiveness of alternative TB screening modalities – in all patients or only symptomatic patients – for hypothetical cohorts of individuals initiating ART in South Africa (mean CD4 cell count = 171 cells/μl; TB prevalence 22%). We simulated no active screening and four diagnostic strategies, smear microscopy (sensitivity 23%); smear and culture (sensitivity, 100%); one Xpert sample (sensitivity in smear-negative TB: 43%); two Xpert samples (sensitivity in smear-negative TB: 62%). Outcomes included projected life expectancy, lifetime costs (2010 US$), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Strategies with ICERs less than $7100 (South African gross domestic product per capita) were considered very cost-effective. Results: Compared with no screening, life expectancy in TB-infected patients increased by 1.6 months using smear in symptomatic patients and by 6.6 months with two Xpert samples in all patients. At 22% TB prevalence, the ICER of smear for all patients was $2800 per year of life saved (YLS), and of Xpert (two samples) for all patients was $5100/YLS. Strategies involving one Xpert sample or symptom screening were less efficient. Conclusion: Model-based analysis suggests that screening all individuals initiating ART in South Africa with two Xpert samples is very cost-effective.",26,0269-9370,987-995 10.1097/QAD.0b013e3283522d47,http://journals.lww.com/aidsonline/Fulltext/2012/05150/The_cost_effectiveness_of_routine_tuberculosis.10.aspx,AIDS
JOUR,article,627,Two-drug antimicrobial chemotherapy: a mathematical model and experiments with Mycobacterium marinum,2012-01-01,"Multi-drug therapy is the standard-of-care treatment for tuberculosis. Despite this, virtually all studies of the pharmacodynamics (PD) of mycobacterial drugs employed for the design of treatment protocols are restricted to single agents. In this report, mathematical models and in vitro experiments with Mycobacterium marinum and five antimycobacterial drugs are used to quantitatively evaluate the pharmaco-, population and evolutionary dynamics of two-drug antimicrobial chemotherapy regimes. Time kill experiments with single and pairs of antibiotics are used to estimate the parameters and evaluate the fit of Hill-function-based PD models. While Hill functions provide excellent fits for the PD of each single antibiotic studied, rifampin, amikacin, clarithromycin, streptomycin and moxifloxacin, two-drug Hill functions with a unique interaction parameter cannot account for the PD of any of the 10 pairs of these drugs. If we assume two antibiotic-concentration dependent functions for the interaction parameter, one for sub-MIC and one for supra-MIC drug concentrations, the modified biphasic Hill function provides a reasonably good fit for the PD of all 10 pairs of antibiotics studied. Monte Carlo simulations of antibiotic treatment based on the experimentally-determined PD functions are used to evaluate the potential microbiological efficacy (rate of clearance) and evolutionary consequences (likelihood of generating multi-drug resistance) of these different drug combinations as well as their sensitivity to different forms of non-adherence to therapy. These two-drug treatment simulations predict varying outcomes for the different pairs of antibiotics with respect to the aforementioned measures of efficacy. In summary, Hill functions with biphasic drug-drug interaction terms provide accurate analogs for the PD of pairs of antibiotics and M. marinum. The models, experimental protocols and computer simulations used in this study can be applied to evaluate the potential microbiological and evolutionary efficacy of two-drug therapy for any bactericidal antibiotics and bacteria that can be cultured in vitro.",8,1553-7374 (Electronic),e1002487,http://www.plospathogens.org/article/fetchObjectAttachment.action?uri=info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1002487&representation=PDF,PLoS Pathog
JOUR,article,1304,Info-gap management of public health Policy for TB with HIV-prevalence and epidemiological uncertainty,2012-01-01,"ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Formulation and evaluation of public health policy commonly employs science-based mathematical models. For instance, epidemiological dynamics of TB is dominated, in general, by flow between actively and latently infected populations. Thus modelling is central in planning public health intervention. However, models are highly uncertain because they are based on observations that are geographically and temporally distinct from the population to which they are applied. AIMS: We aim to demonstrate the advantages of info-gap theory, a non-probabilistic approach to severe uncertainty when worst cases cannot be reliably identified and probability distributions are unreliable or unavailable. Info-gap is applied here to mathematical modelling of epidemics and analysis of public health decision-making. METHODS: Applying info-gap robustness analysis to tuberculosis/HIV (TB/HIV) epidemics, we illustrate the critical role of incorporating uncertainty in formulating recommendations for interventions. Robustness is assessed as the magnitude of uncertainty that can be tolerated by a given intervention. We illustrate the methodology by exploring interventions that alter the rates of diagnosis, cure, relapse and HIV infection. RESULTS: We demonstrate several policy implications. Equivalence among alternative rates of diagnosis and relapse are identified. The impact of initial TB and HIV prevalence on the robustness to uncertainty is quantified. In some configurations, increased aggressiveness of intervention improves the predicted outcome but also reduces the robustness to uncertainty. Similarly, predicted outcomes may be better at larger target times, but may also be more vulnerable to model error. CONCLUSIONS: The info-gap framework is useful for managing model uncertainty and is attractive when uncertainties on model parameters are extreme. When a public health model underlies guidelines, info-gap decision theory provides valuable insight into the confidence of achieving agreed-upon goals.",12,1471-2458 (Electronic),1091,http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/12/1091,BMC Public Health

Furthermore, we formulate conditions for the validity of this modeling approximation and we illustrate them numerically for the cases of cholera and influenza.

In addition to experimental approaches, these modeling tools have recently been applied to address open questions regarding host-pathogen interaction dynamics, including the immune response to mycobacterial infection and tuberculous granuloma formation. We present an approach in which a computational model represents the interaction of the Mycobacterium infection with the innate immune system in zebrafish at a high level of abstraction. We use the Petri Net formalism to model the interaction between the key host elements involved in granuloma formation and infection dissemination. We define a qualitative model for the understanding and description of causal relations in this dynamic process. Complex processes involving cell-cell or cell-bacteria communication can be modeled at smaller scales and incorporated hierarchically into this main model; these are to be included in later elaborations. With the infection mechanism being defined on a higher level, lower-level processes influencing the host-pathogen interaction can be identified, modeled, and tested both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Because monthly data may exhibit seasonal patterns, we need to consider seasonally adjusted models, which can be theoretically complex and computationally intensive. We propose a combination of methods to reduce the complexity of modeling seasonal data and to provide estimates for a change in trend when the timing and magnitude of the change are unknown. To assess potential changes in trend, we first used autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models to analyze the residuals and forecast errors, followed by multiple ARIMA intervention models to estimate the timing and magnitude of the change. Because the variable corresponding to time of change is not a statistical parameter, its confidence bounds cannot be estimated by intervention models. To model timing of change and its credible interval, we developed a Bayesian technique. We avoided the need for computationally intensive simulations by deriving a closed form for the posterior distribution of the time of change.

JOUR,article,733,Heterogeneity in tuberculosis transmission and the role of geographic hotspots in propagating epidemics,2012-01-01,"The importance of high-incidence ""hotspots"" to population-level tuberculosis (TB) incidence remains poorly understood. TB incidence varies widely across countries, but within smaller geographic areas (e.g., cities), TB transmission may be more homogeneous than other infectious diseases. We constructed a steady-state compartmental model of TB in Rio de Janeiro, replicating nine epidemiological variables (e.g., TB incidence) within 1% of their observed values. We estimated the proportion of TB transmission originating from a high-incidence hotspot (6.0% of the city's population, 16.5% of TB incidence) and the relative impact of TB control measures targeting the hotspot vs. the general community. If each case of active TB in the hotspot caused 0.5 secondary transmissions in the general community for each within-hotspot transmission, the 6.0% of people living in the hotspot accounted for 35.3% of city-wide TB transmission. Reducing the TB transmission rate (i.e., number of secondary infections per infectious case) in the hotspot to that in the general community reduced city-wide TB incidence by 9.8% in year 5, and 29.7% in year 50-an effect similar to halving time to diagnosis for the remaining 94% of the community. The importance of the hotspot to city-wide TB control depended strongly on the extent of TB transmission from the hotspot to the general community. High-incidence hotspots may play an important role in propagating TB epidemics. Achieving TB control targets in a hotspot containing 6% of a city's population can have similar impact on city-wide TB incidence as achieving the same targets throughout the remaining community.",NA,1091-6490 (Electronic),NA,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22645356,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA

Methods: A behavioural model of patient-doctor interactions embedded in an epidemiological model of Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission, linked to field data, was used to investigate the effects of early diagnosis in preventing future TB cases. Results: New diagnostic tests for active TB will have a bigger impact sooner where: disease incidence is high and most cases are due to recent infection; advances in test technology (test sensitivity, specificity, etc.) are combined with early diagnosis; new tests have not only better technical specifications than current tests, but also compensate for the misuse of existing tests; health system delays are long compared with patient delays, assuming the former are more amenable to change. Interpretation & conclusions: New diagnostic tests will certainly improve TB control, but the highest impact will be obtained by applying tests with higher sensitivity and specificity early in the infectious period.

JOUR,article,753,Screening of healthcare workers for tuberculosis: development and validation of a new health economic model to inform practice,2012-01-01,"BACKGROUND: Methods for determining cost-effectiveness of different treatments are well established, unlike appraisal of non-drug interventions, including novel diagnostics and biomarkers. OBJECTIVE: The authors develop and validate a new health economic model by comparing cost-effectiveness of tuberculin skin test (TST); blood test, interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) and TST followed by IGRA in conditional sequence, in screening healthcare workers for latent or active tuberculosis (TB). DESIGN: The authors focus on healthy life years gained as the benefit metric, rather than quality-adjusted life years given limited data to estimate quality adjustments of life years with TB and complications of treatment, like hepatitis. Healthy life years gained refer to the number of TB or hepatitis cases avoided and the increase in life expectancy. The authors incorporate disease and test parameters informed by systematic meta-analyses and clinical practice. Health and economic outcomes of each strategy are modelled as a decision tree in Markov chains, representing different health states informed by epidemiology. Cost and effectiveness values are generated as the individual is cycled through 20 years of the model. Key parameters undergo one-way and Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analyses. SETTING: Screening healthcare workers in secondary and tertiary care. RESULTS: IGRA is the most effective strategy, with incremental costs per healthy life year gained of pound10 614- pound20 929, base case, pound8021- pound18 348, market costs TST pound45, IGRA pound90, IGRA specificities of 99%-97%; mean (5%, 95%), pound12 060 ( pound4137- pound38 418) by Monte Carlo analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Incremental costs per healthy life year gained, a conservative estimate of benefit, are comparable to the pound20 000- pound30 000 NICE band for IGRA alone, across wide differences in disease and test parameters. Health gains justify IGRA costs, even if IGRA tests cost three times TST.

JOUR,article,784,How host heterogeneity governs tuberculosis reinfection?,2012-01-01,"Recurrent episodes of tuberculosis (TB) can be due to relapse of latent infection or exogenous reinfection, and discrimination is crucial for control planning. Molecular genotyping of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates offers concrete opportunities to measure the relative contribution of reinfection in recurrent disease. Here, a mathematical model of TB transmission is fitted to data from 14 molecular epidemiology studies, enabling the estimation of relevant epidemiological parameters. Meta-analysis reveals that rates of reinfection after successful treatment are higher than rates of new TB, raising an important question about the underlying mechanism. We formulate two alternative mechanisms within our model framework: (i) infection increases susceptibility to reinfection or (ii) infection affects individuals differentially, thereby recruiting high-risk individuals to the group at risk for reinfection. The second mechanism is better supported by the fittings to the data, suggesting that reinfection rates are inflated through a population phenomenon that occurs in the presence of heterogeneity in individual risk of infection. As a result, rates of reinfection are higher when measured at the population level even though they might be lower at the individual level. Finally, differential host recruitment is modulated by transmission intensity, being less pronounced when incidence is high.",279,1471-2954 (Electronic),2473-8,http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/279/1737/2473.full.pdf,Proc Biol Sci
JOUR,article,797,Understanding communication signals during mycobacterial latency through predicted genome-wide protein interactions and boolean modeling,2012-01-01,"About 90% of the people infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis carry latent bacteria that are believed to get activated upon immune suppression. One of the fundamental challenges in the control of tuberculosis is therefore to understand molecular mechanisms involved in the onset of latency and/or reactivation. We have attempted to address this problem at the systems level by a combination of predicted functional protein:protein interactions, integration of functional interactions with large scale gene expression studies, predicted transcription regulatory network and finally simulations with a boolean model of the network. Initially a prediction for genome-wide protein functional linkages was obtained based on genome-context methods using a Support Vector Machine. This set of protein functional linkages along with gene expression data of the available models of latency was employed to identify proteins involved in mediating switch signals during dormancy. We show that genes that are up and down regulated during dormancy are not only coordinately regulated under dormancy-like conditions but also under a variety of other experimental conditions. Their synchronized regulation indicates that they form a tightly regulated gene cluster and might form a latency-regulon. Conservation of these genes across bacterial species suggests a unique evolutionary history that might be associated with M. tuberculosis dormancy. Finally, simulations with a boolean model based on the regulatory network with logical relationships derived from gene expression data reveals a bistable switch suggesting alternating latent and actively growing states. Our analysis based on the interaction network therefore reveals a potential model of M. tuberculosis latency.",7,1932-6203 (Electronic),e33893,http://www.plosone.org/article/fetchObjectAttachment.action?uri=info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0033893&representation=PDF,PLoS One

We find that only 6 of the 50 parameters analysed are important to the cumulative number of clinically active TB patients in the entire region. Of these, only the detection rate in PNG is found to be an important intervention parameter. We therefore give insight into the extent the area with the high burden of TB (PNG in the case study) is dominating the TB dynamics of the entire region. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis results give insight into the data that most important to collect and refine, which is found to be data relating to the PNG parameters.",7,1932-6203 (Electronic) 1932-6203 (Linking),e34411,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&dopt=Citation&list_uids=22496801,PLoS One
JOUR,article,1410,Modelling tuberculosis trends in the USA,2012-01-01,"We present a mathematical transmission model of tuberculosis in the USA. The model is calibrated to recent trends of declining incidence in the US-born and foreign-born populations and is used in assessing relative impacts of treatment of latently infected individuals on elimination time, where elimination is defined as annual incidence <1 case/million. Provided current control efforts are maintained, elimination in the US-born population can be achieved before the end of this century. However, elimination in the foreign-born population is unlikely in this timeframe even with higher rates of targeted testing and treatment of residents of and immigrants to the USA with latent tuberculosis infection. Cutting transmission of disease as an interim step would shorten the time to elimination in the US-born population but foreign-born rates would remain above the elimination target.",140,1469-4409 (Electronic),1862-72,http://journals.cambridge.org/download.php?file=%2FHYG%2FHYG140_10%2FS095026881100286Xa.pdf&code=e69da0c8eec17422533e435a6523a1b7,Epidemiol Infect
JOUR,article,808,Strategies for treating latent multiple-drug resistant tuberculosis: a decision analysis,2012-01-01,"BACKGROUND: The optimal treatment for latent multiple-drug resistant tuberculosis infection remains unclear. In anticipation of future clinical trials, we modeled the expected performance of six potential regimens for treatment of latent multiple-drug resistant tuberculosis. METHODS: A computerized Markov model to analyze the total cost of treatment for six different regimens: Pyrazinamide/ethambutol, moxifloxacin monotherapy, moxifloxacin/pyrazinamide, moxifloxacin/ethambutol, moxifloxacin/ethionamide, and moxifloxacin/PA-824. Efficacy estimates were extrapolated from mouse models and examined over a wide range of assumptions. RESULTS: In the base-case, moxifloxacin monotherapy was the lowest cost strategy, but moxifloxacin/ethambutol was cost-effective at an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $21,252 per quality-adjusted life-year. Both pyrazinamide-containing regimens were dominated due to their toxicity. A hypothetical regimen of low toxicity and even modest efficacy was cost-effective compared to ""no treatment."" CONCLUSION: In our model, moxifloxacin/ethambutol was the preferred treatment strategy under a wide range of assumptions; pyrazinamide-containing regimens fared poorly because of high rates of toxicity. Although more data are needed on efficacy of treatments for latent MDR-TB infection, data on toxicity and treatment discontinuation, which are easier to obtain, could have a substantial impact on public health practice.",7,1932-6203 (Electronic),e30194,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3260212/pdf/pone.0030194.pdf,PLoS One
JOUR,article,811,The cost effectiveness of Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques for the diagnosis of tuberculosis,2012-01-01,"BACKGROUND: There is wide variation in the techniques deployed to diagnose tuberculosis in the UK, with little agreement on which tools or strategies are cost effective. This analysis therefore comprehensively evaluated the cost effectiveness of currently available diagnostic strategies for routine diagnosis of TB in the NHS. METHODS: The analysis compared strategies consisting of Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques, culture and microscopy. A decision tree was used to estimate costs and Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) from a UK health service perspective. The sensitivity and specificity of each test determined the true and false positive and negative results in patients suspected of having active tuberculosis. These results led to either early, correct diagnosis or delayed diagnosis and the associated costs and QALYs. The presence of active tuberculosis combined with the side effects of treatment was associated with reduction in quality of life. Costs included were test costs, drug costs and the management of tuberculosis. Drug costs were based on generic UK list prices. Uncertainty in the model was explored through probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: The cost effective strategy at threshold of pound20,000 per QALY was a strategy using only sputum microscopy and culture routinely, meaning Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques are not cost effective at baseline. When the prevalence of tuberculosis was increased, however, nucleic acid amplification became cost effective at the same threshold. Aside from the prevalence, the results were shown to be robust. At low tuberculosis prevalence, Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques may not be cost effective but their potential in higher prevalence situations is considerable.",106,1532-3064 (Electronic) 0954-6111 (Linking),300-307,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22137190,Respiratory medicine
JOUR,article,831,Modelling the impacts of new diagnostic tools for tuberculosis in developing countries to enhance policy decisions,2012-01-01,"The introduction and scale-up of new tools for the diagnosis of Tuberculosis (TB) in developing countries has the potential to make a huge difference to the lives of millions of people living in poverty. To achieve this, policy makers need the information to make the right decisions about which new tools to implement and where in the diagnostic algorithm to apply them most effectively. These decisions are difficult as the new tools are often expensive to implement and use, and the health system and patient impacts uncertain, particularly in developing countries where there is a high burden of TB. The authors demonstrate that a discrete event simulation model could play a significant part in improving and informing these decisions. The feasibility of linking the discrete event simulation to a dynamic epidemiology model is also explored in order to take account of longer term impacts on the incidence of TB. Results from two diagnostic districts in Tanzania are used to illustrate how the approach could be used to improve decisions.",15,1386-9620 (Print),239-53,http://www.springerlink.com/content/u768lr018r04t135/fulltext.pdf,Health Care Manag Sci
JOUR,article,832,Cost-Effectiveness of Latent Tuberculosis Screening Before Steroid Therapy for Idiopathic Nephrotic Syndrome in Children,2012-01-01,"BACKGROUND: Guidelines differ on screening recommendations for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) prior to immunosuppressive therapy. We aimed to determine the most cost-effective LTBI screening strategy before long-term steroid therapy in a child with new-onset idiopathic nephrotic syndrome. STUDY DESIGN: Markov state-transition model. SETTING & POPULATION: 5-year-old boy with new-onset idiopathic nephrotic syndrome. MODEL, PERSPECTIVE, & TIMEFRAME: The Markov model took a societal perspective over a lifetime horizon. INTERVENTION: 3 strategies were compared: universal tuberculin skin testing (TST), targeted screening using a risk-factor questionnaire, and no screening. A secondary model included the newer interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs), requiring only one visit and having greater specificity than TST. OUTCOMES: Marginal cost-effectiveness ratios (2010 US dollars) with effectiveness measured as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). RESULTS: At an LTBI prevalence of 1.1% (the average US childhood prevalence in our base case), a no-screening strategy dominated ($2,201; 29.3356 QALYs) targeted screening ($2,218; 29.3356 QALYs) and universal TST ($2,481; 29.3347 QALYs). At a prevalence >10.3%, targeted screening with a risk-factor questionnaire was the most cost-effective option. Higher than a prevalence of 58.5%, universal TST was preferred. In the secondary model, targeted screening with a questionnaire followed by IGRA testing was cost-effective compared with no screening in the base case when the LTBI prevalence was >4.9%. LIMITATIONS: There is no established gold standard for the diagnosis of LTBI. Results of any modeling task are limited by the accuracy of available data. CONCLUSIONS: Prior to starting steroid therapy, only patients in areas with a high prevalence of LTBI will benefit from universal TST. As more evidence becomes available about the use of IGRA testing in children, the assay may become a component of cost-effective screening protocols in populations with a higher burden of LTBI.",NA,1523-6838 (Electronic),NA,NA,Am J Kidney Dis
JOUR,article,1376,Assessing the transmission risk of multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis epidemics in regions of Taiwan,2012-01-01,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to link transmission dynamics with a probabilistic risk model to provide a mechanistically explicit assessment for estimating the multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) infection risk in regions of Taiwan. METHODS: A relative fitness (RF)-based MDR TB model was used to describe transmission, validated with disease data for the period 2006-2010. A dose-response model quantifying by basic reproduction number (R(0)) and total proportion of infected population was constructed to estimate the site-specific MDR TB infection risk. RESULTS: We found that the incidence rate of MDR TB was highest in Hwalien County (4.91 per 100,000 population) in eastern Taiwan, with drug-sensitive and multidrug-resistant R(0) estimates of 0.89 (95% CI 0.23-2.17) and 0.38 (95% CI 0.05-1.30), respectively. The predictions were in apparent agreement with observed data in the 95% credible intervals. Our simulation showed that the incidence of MDR TB will be falling by 2013-2016. Our results indicated that the selected regions of Taiwan had only approximately 1% probability of exceeding 50% of the population with infection attributed to MDR TB.

JOUR,article,1329,The impact of new tuberculosis diagnostics on transmission: why context matters,2012-01-01,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the impact of new tuberculosis diagnostics on tuberculosis transmission given the complex contextual factors that can lead to patient loss before diagnosis or treatment. METHODS: An epidemic model of tuberculosis specifying discrete steps along the tuberculosis diagnostic pathway was constructed. The model was calibrated to the epidemiology of tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in the United Republic of Tanzania and was used to assess the impact of a new diagnostic tool with 70% sensitivity for smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis. The influence of contextual factors on the projected epidemic impact of the new diagnostic tool over the decade following introduction was explored. FINDINGS: With the use of smear microscopy, the incidence of tuberculosis will decline by an average of 3.94% per year. If the new tool is added, incidence will decline by an annual 4.25%. This represents an absolute change of 0.31 percentage points (95% confidence interval: 0.04-0.42). However, the annual decline in transmission with use of the new tool is less when existing strategies for the diagnosis of smear-negative cases have high sensitivity and when symptomatic individuals delay in seeking care. Other influential contextual factors include access to tuberculosis care, patient loss before diagnosis, initial patient default after diagnosis and treatment success rate. CONCLUSION: When implementing and scaling up the use of a new diagnostic tool, the operational context in which diagnosis and treatment take place needs to be considered.",90,1564-0604 (Electronic),739-747A,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3471051/pdf/BLT.11.101436.pdf,Bull World Health Organ
JOUR,article,855,"A mathematical representation of the development of Mycobacterium tuberculosis active, latent and dormant stages",2012-01-01,"The majority of individuals infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) bacilli develop latent infection. Mtb becomes dormant and phenotypically drug resistant when it encounters multiple stresses within the host, and expresses a set of genes, known as the dormancy regulon, in vivo. These genes are expressed in vitro in response to nitric oxide (NO), hypoxia (oxygen deprivation), and nutrient starvation. The occurrence and reactivation of latent tuberculosis (TB) is not clearly understood. The ability of the pathogen to enter and exit from different states is associated with its ability to cause persistent infection. During infection it is not known whether the organism is in a persistent slow replicating state or a dormant non-replicating state, with the latter ultimately causing a latent infection with the potential to reactivate to active disease. We collected gene expression data for Mtb bacilli under different stress conditions that simulate latency or dormancy. Time course experiments were selected and differentially expressed gene profiles were determined at each time point. A mathematical model was then developed to show the dynamics of Mtb latency based on the profile of differentially expressed genes. Analysis of the time course data show the dynamics of latency occurrence in vitro and the mathematical model reveals all possible scenarios of Mtb latency development with respect to the different conditions that may be produced by the immune response in vivo. The mathematical model provides a biological explanation of how Mtb latency occurs based on observed gene expression changes in in vitro latency models.",292,1095-8541 (Electronic),44-59,http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0022519311004899/1-s2.0-S0022519311004899-main.pdf?_tid=d54d8d90a3eba9c169d9501e63fde212&acdnat=1345012620_a88a65a3fb97213412ab8f9ff9770d74,J Theor Biol

We evaluate the cost-effectiveness of different strategies to actively screen for TB disease in HIV positive individuals, where isoniazid preventative therapy (IPT) is given to those screening negative, and use value of information analysis (VOI) to identify future research priorities. METHODOLOGY/ PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We built an individual sampling model to investigate the costs (2010 US Dollars) and consequences of screening for TB, and providing TB treatment or IPT in adults testing HIV positive in Sub-Saharan Africa. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to assess performance of the nine different TB screening strategies evaluated. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted to incorporate decision uncertainty, and expected value of perfect information for the entire model and for groups of parameters was calculated. Screening all HIV infected individuals with sputum microscopy was the least costly strategy, with other strategies not cost-effective at WHO recommended thresholds. Screening those with TB symptoms with sputum microscopy and CXR would be cost-effective at a threshold ICER of $7,800 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY), but associated with significant uncertainty. VOI analysis suggests further information would be of value. CONCLUSIONS/ SIGNIFICANCE: Resource-constrained countries in sub-Saharan Africa wishing to scale up TB preventative services in their HIV infected populations should consider expanding laboratory facilities to enable increased screening for TB with sputum microscopy, whilst improved estimates of the TB prevalence in the population to be screened are needed, as it may influence the optimal strategy.",7,1932-6203 (Electronic),e30457,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22291958,PLoS One
JOUR,article,1402,Optimal incentives for allocating HIV/AIDS prevention resources among multiple populations,2012-01-01,"Many agencies, such as the United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Bank, the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, provide funding to prevent HIV/AIDS infections worldwide. These funds are allocated at multiple levels, resulting in a highly complicated distribution process. An oversight agency allocates funds to various national-level decision-makers who then allocate funds to regional-level decision-makers who in turn distribute the monies to local organizations, programs, or risk groups. Simple allocation techniques are often preferred by the decision-makers at each administrative level, but such methods can lead to sub-optimal allocation of funds. Thus, incentives could be provided to decisionmakers in order to encourage optimal allocation of HIV/AIDS prevention resources. We formulate an incentive-based resource allocation model that takes into consideration strategic interactions between decision-makers in a multiple-level resource-allocation process. We analyze each decision-maker's behavior at the equilibrium and summarize the results that characterize the optimal solution to the resource-allocation problem. Our intended audiences are technical experts, decision-makers, and policy-makers in governments who can make use of incentives to encourage effective decisions regarding HIV/AIDS policy modeling and budget allocation at local levels.",15,1386-9620 (Print),327-38,http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/918/art%253A10.1007%252Fs10729-012-9194-y.pdf?auth66=1364494250_6683b3a8e48dc76cf0de0d0dd71994f2&ext=.pdf,Health Care Manag Sci
JOUR,article,581,Rifampicin for continuation phase tuberculosis treatment in Uganda: a cost-effectiveness analysis,2012-01-01,"BACKGROUND: In Uganda, isoniazid plus ethambutol is used for 6 months (6HE) during the continuation treatment phase of new tuberculosis (TB) cases. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends using isoniazid plus rifampicin for 4 months (4HR) instead of 6HE. We compared the impact of a continuation phase using 6HE or 4HR on total cost and expected mortality from the perspective of the Ugandan national health system. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Treatment costs and outcomes were determined by decision analysis. Median daily drug price was US$0.115 for HR and US$0.069 for HE. TB treatment failure or relapse and mortality rates associated with 6HE vs. 4HR were obtained from randomized trials and systematic reviews for HIV-negative (46% of TB cases; failure/relapse -6HE: 10.4% vs. 4HR: 5.2%; mortality -6HE: 5.6% vs. 4HR: 3.5%) and HIV-positive patients (54% of TB cases; failure or relapse -6HE: 13.7% vs. 4HR: 12.4%; mortality -6HE: 16.6% vs. 4HR: 10.5%). When the initial treatment is not successful, retreatment involves an additional 8-month drug-regimen at a cost of $110.70. The model predicted a mortality rate of 13.3% for patients treated with 6HE and 8.8% for 4HR; average treatment cost per patient was predicted at $26.07 for 6HE and $23.64 for 4HR. These results were robust to the inclusion of MDR-TB as an additional outcome after treatment failure or relapse. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Combination therapy with 4HR in the continuation phase dominates 6HE as it is associated with both lower expected costs and lower expected mortality.

JOUR,article,861,Modelling the cost-effectiveness of strategies to prevent tuberculosis in child contacts in a high-burden setting,2012-01-01,"BACKGROUND: WHO recommends isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) for young children in close contact with an infectious tuberculosis (TB) case. No models have examined the cost effectiveness of this recommendation. METHODS: A decision analysis model was developed to estimate health and economic outcomes of five TB infection screening strategies in young household contacts. In the no-testing strategy, children received IPT based on age and reported exposure. Other strategies included testing for infection with a tuberculin skin test (TST), interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) or IGRA after TST. Markov modelling included age-specific disease states and probabilities while considering risk of re-infection in a high-burden country. RESULTS: Among the 0-2-year-old cohort, the no-testing strategy was most cost effective. The discounted societal cost of care per life year saved ranged from US$237 (no-testing) to US$538 (IGRA only testing). Among the 3-5-year-old cohort, strategies employing an IGRA after a negative TST were most effective, but were associated with significant incremental cost (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio >US$233 000), depending on the rate of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. CONCLUSION: Screening for M tuberculosis infection and provision of IPT in young children is a highly cost-effective intervention. Screening without testing for M tuberculosis infection is the most cost-effective strategy in 0-2-year-old children and the preferred strategy in 3-5-year-old children. Lack of testing capacity should therefore not be a barrier to IPT delivery. These findings highlight the cost effectiveness of contact tracing and IPT delivery in young children exposed to TB in high-burden countries.",NA,1468-3296 (Electronic),NA,http://thorax.bmj.com/content/early/2012/06/19/thoraxjnl-2011-200933,Thorax
JOUR,article,1316,Population health impact and cost-effectiveness of tuberculosis diagnosis with Xpert MTB/RIF: a dynamic simulation and economic evaluation,2012-01-01,"BACKGROUND: The Xpert MTB/RIF test enables rapid detection of tuberculosis (TB) and rifampicin resistance. The World Health Organization recommends Xpert for initial diagnosis in individuals suspected of having multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) or HIV-associated TB, and many countries are moving quickly toward adopting Xpert. As roll-out proceeds, it is essential to understand the potential health impact and cost-effectiveness of diagnostic strategies based on Xpert. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We evaluated potential health and economic consequences of implementing Xpert in five southern African countries--Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa, and Swaziland--where drug resistance and TB-HIV coinfection are prevalent. Using a calibrated, dynamic mathematical model, we compared the status quo diagnostic algorithm, emphasizing sputum smear, against an algorithm incorporating Xpert for initial diagnosis. Results were projected over 10- and 20-y time periods starting from 2012. Compared to status quo, implementation of Xpert would avert 132,000 (95% CI: 55,000-284,000) TB cases and 182,000 (97,000-302,000) TB deaths in southern Africa over the 10 y following introduction, and would reduce prevalence by 28% (14%-40%) by 2022, with more modest reductions in incidence. Health system costs are projected to increase substantially with Xpert, by US$460 million (294-699 million) over 10 y. Antiretroviral therapy for HIV represents a substantial fraction of these additional costs, because of improved survival in TB/HIV-infected populations through better TB case-finding and treatment. Costs for treating MDR-TB are also expected to rise significantly with Xpert scale-up. Relative to status quo, Xpert has an estimated cost-effectiveness of US$959 (633-1,485) per disability-adjusted life-year averted over 10 y. Across countries, cost-effectiveness ratios ranged from US$792 (482-1,785) in Swaziland to US$1,257 (767-2,276) in Botswana. Assessing outcomes over a 10-y period focuses on the near-term consequences of Xpert adoption, but the cost-effectiveness results are conservative, with cost-effectiveness ratios assessed over a 20-y time horizon approximately 20% lower than the 10-y values. CONCLUSIONS: Introduction of Xpert could substantially change TB morbidity and mortality through improved case-finding and treatment, with more limited impact on long-term transmission dynamics. Despite extant uncertainty about TB natural history and intervention impact in southern Africa, adoption of Xpert evidently offers reasonable value for its cost, based on conventional benchmarks for cost-effectiveness. However, the additional financial burden would be substantial, including significant increases in costs for treating HIV and MDR-TB. Given the fundamental influence of HIV on TB dynamics and intervention costs, care should be taken when interpreting the results of this analysis outside of settings with high HIV prevalence.",9,1549-1676 (Electronic),e1001347,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3502465/pdf/pmed.1001347.pdf,PLoS Med
JOUR,article,585,The Impact and Cost of Scaling up GeneXpert MTB/RIF in South Africa,2012-01-01,"OBJECTIVE: We estimated the incremental cost and impact on diagnosis and treatment uptake of national rollout of Xpert MTB/RIF technology (Xpert) for the diagnosis of pulmonary TB above the cost of current guidelines for the years 2011 to 2016 in South Africa. METHODS: We parameterised a population-level decision model with data from national-level TB databases (n = 199,511) and implementation studies. The model follows cohorts of TB suspects from diagnosis to treatment under current diagnostic guidelines or an algorithm that includes Xpert. Assumptions include the number of TB suspects, symptom prevalence of 5.5%, annual suspect growth rate of 10%, and 2010 public-sector salaries and drug and service delivery costs. Xpert test costs are based on data from an in-country pilot evaluation and assumptions about when global volumes allowing cartridge discounts will be reached. RESULTS: At full scale, Xpert will increase the number of TB cases diagnosed per year by 30%-37% and the number of MDR-TB cases diagnosed by 69%-71%. It will diagnose 81% of patients after the first visit, compared to 46% currently. The cost of TB diagnosis per suspect will increase by 55% to USD 60-61 and the cost of diagnosis and treatment per TB case treated by 8% to USD 797-873. The incremental capital cost of the Xpert scale-up will be USD 22 million and the incremental recurrent cost USD 287-316 million over six years. CONCLUSION: Xpert will increase both the number of TB cases diagnosed and treated and the cost of TB diagnosis.

The present study aimed to develop a formal hypothesis: tuberculosis (TB) was associated with the W-shaped influenza mortality from 1918-19. Three pieces of epidemiological information were assessed: (i) the epidemic records containing the age-specific numbers of cases and deaths of influenza from 1918-19, (ii) an outbreak record of influenza in a Swiss TB sanatorium during the pandemic, and (iii) the age-dependent TB mortality over time in the early 20th century. Analyzing the data (i), we found that the W-shaped pattern was not only seen in mortality but also in the age-specific case fatality ratio, suggesting the presence of underlying age-specific risk factor(s) of influenza death among young adults. From the data (ii), TB was shown to be associated with influenza death (P = 0.09), and there was no influenza death among non-TB controls. The data (iii) were analyzed by employing the age-period-cohort model, revealing harvesting effect in the period function of TB mortality shortly after the 1918-19 pandemic.

OBJECTIVE: To explore different methods for environmental assessment and mathematical modelling to predict TB transmission risk and devise a tool for public health practitioners for use in TB investigations. DESIGN: Parameters including air flow, carbon dioxide (CO(2)) and airborne particles were measured over 3 working days in an office with a staff member with infectious TB. The Wells-Riley model was applied to predict transmission rates. RESULTS: The results suggested that poor ventilation and well-mixed air led to equal exposure of staff members to airborne TB bacilli. The model's prediction of attack rate (42%) supported the actual number of infections that occurred (50%). CONCLUSION: This study supports the use of environmental assessment and modelling as a tool for public health practitioners to determine the extent of TB exposure and to inform TB screening strategies.

JOUR,article,591,The cost-effectiveness of tuberculosis preventive therapy for HIV-infected individuals in southern India: a trial-based analysis,2012-01-01,"BACKGROUND: Regimens for isoniazid-based preventive therapy (IPT) for tuberculosis (TB) in HIV-infected individuals have not been widely adopted given concerns regarding efficacy, adherence and drug resistance. Further, the cost-effectiveness of IPT has not been studied in India. METHODS: We used an HIV/TB model to project TB incidence, life expectancy, cost and incremental cost-effectiveness of six months of isoniazid plus ethambutol (6EH), thirty-six months of isoniazid (36H) and no IPT for HIV-infected patients in India. Model input parameters included a median CD4 count of 324 cells/mm(3), and a rate ratio of developing TB of 0.35 for 6EH and 0.22 for 36H at three years as compared to no IPT. Results of 6EH and 36H were also compared to six months of isoniazid (6H), three months of isoniazid plus rifampin (3RH) and three months of isoniazid plus rifapentine (3RPTH). RESULTS: Projected TB incidence decreased in the 6EH and 36H regimens by 51% and 62% respectively at three-year follow-up compared to no IPT. Without IPT, projected life expectancy was 136.1 months at a lifetime per person cost of $5,630. 6EH increased life expectancy by 0.8 months at an additional per person cost of $100 (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $1,490/year of life saved (YLS)). 36H further increased life expectancy by 0.2 months with an additional per person cost of $55 (ICER of $3,120/YLS). The projected clinical impact of 6EH was comparable to 6H and 3RH; however when compared to these other options, 6EH was no longer cost-effective given the high cost of ethambutol. Results were sensitive to baseline CD4 count and adherence. CONCLUSIONS: Three, six and thirty-six-month regimens of isoniazid-based therapy are effective in preventing TB. Three months of isoniazid plus rifampin and six-months of isoniazid are similarly cost-effective in India, and should be considered part of HIV care.",7,1932-6203 (Electronic) 1932-6203 (Linking),e36001,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22558301,PLoS One
JOUR,article,1297,Tuberculosis surveillance using a hidden markov model,2012-01-01,"BACKGROUND: Routinely collected data from tuberculosis surveillance system can be used to investigate and monitor the irregularities and abrupt changes of the disease incidence. We aimed at using a Hidden Markov Model in order to detect the abnormal states of pulmonary tuberculosis in Iran. METHODS: Data for this study were the weekly number of newly diagnosed cases with sputum smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis reported between April 2005 and March 2011 throughout Iran. In order to detect the unusual states of the disease, two Hidden Markov Models were applied to the data with and without seasonal trends as baselines. Consequently, the best model was selected and compared with the results of Serfling epidemic threshold which is typically used in the surveillance of infectious diseases. RESULTS: Both adjusted R-squared and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) reflected better goodness-of-fit for the model with seasonal trends (0.72 and -1336.66, respectively) than the model without seasonality (0.56 and -1386.75). Moreover, according to the Serfling epidemic threshold, higher values of sensitivity and specificity suggest a higher validity for the seasonal model (0.87 and 0.94, respectively) than model without seasonality (0.73 and 0.68, respectively). CONCLUSION: A two-state Hidden Markov Model along with a seasonal trend as a function of the model parameters provides an effective warning system for the surveillance of tuberculosis.",41,2251-6085 (Print),87-96,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3494236/pdf/ijph-41-87.pdf,Iran J Public Health
JOUR,article,1310,Modelling HIV and MTB co-infection including combined treatment strategies,2012-01-01,"A new host-pathogen model is described that simulates HIV-MTB co-infection and treatment, with the objective of testing treatment strategies. The model includes CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, resting and activated macrophages, HIV and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). For TB presentation at various stages of HIV disease in a co-infected individual, combined treatment strategies were tested with different relative timings of treatment for each infection. The stages were early HIV disease, late HIV disease and AIDS. The main strategies were TB treatment followed by anti-retroviral therapy (ART) after delays of 15 days, 2 months and 6 months. ART followed by TB treatment was an additional strategy that was tested. Treatment was simulated with and without drug interaction. Simulation results were that TB treatment first followed by ART after a stage-dependent delay has the best outcome. During early HIV disease a 6 month delay is acceptable. During late HIV disease, a 2 month delay is best. During AIDS it is better to start ART after 15 days. However, drug interaction works against the benefits of early ART. These results agree with expert reviews and clinical trials.",7,1932-6203 (Electronic),e49492,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3509125/pdf/pone.0049492.pdf,PLoS One
JOUR,article,1380,Feasibility of a fixed-dose regimen of pyrazinamide and its impact on systemic drug exposure and liver safety in patients with tuberculosis,2012-01-01,"Historically, dosing regimens for the treatment of tuberculosis (TB) have been proposed in an empirical manner. Dose selection has often been the result of efficacy trials in which drugs were administered regardless of the magnitude of the effect of demographic factors on drug disposition. This has created challenges for the prescription of fixed-dose combinations with novel therapeutic agents. The objectives of this investigation were to evaluate the impact of body weight on the overall systemic exposure to pyrazinamide (PZA) and to assess whether the use of one fixed dose, without adjustment according to weight, would ensure target exposure and safety requirements across the overall patient population. Using a population pharmacokinetic model, simulation scenarios were explored based on population demographics from clinical trials in TB patients and on historical hepatotoxicity data. The systemic drug exposure (area under the concentration-time curve [AUC]), peak concentrations (the maximum concentration of drug in serum [C(max)]), the time above the MIC (t > MIC), and the risk of hepatotoxicity were evaluated for the current weight-banded regimen and compared to fixed doses under the assumption that pharmacokinetic differences are the primary drivers of toxicity. Evaluation of the standard weight banding reveals that more than 50% of subjects in the weight range of 45 to 55 kg remain below the proposed target exposure to PZA. In contrast, the use of a fixed 1,500-mg dose resulted in a lower proportion of subjects under the target value, with a 0.2% average overall increase in the risk of hepatotoxicity. Our results strongly support the use of a fixed-dose regimen for PZA in coformulation or combination with novel therapeutic agents.",56,1098-6596 (Electronic),5442-9,http://aac.asm.org/content/56/11/5442.full.pdf,Antimicrob Agents Chemother
JOUR,article,601,Modeling the dynamic relationship between HIV and the risk of drug-resistant tuberculosis,2012-01-01,"The emergence of highly drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) and interactions between TB and HIV epidemics pose serious challenges for TB control. Previous researchers have presented several hypotheses for why HIV-coinfected TB patients may suffer an increased risk of drug-resistant TB (DRTB) compared to other TB patients. Although some studies have found a positive association between an individual's HIV status and his or her subsequent risk of multidrug-resistant TB (MDRTB), the observed individual-level relationship between HIV and DRTB varies substantially among settings. Here, we develop a modeling framework to explore the effect of HIV on the dynamics of DRTB. The model captures the acquisition of resistance to important classes of TB drugs, imposes fitness costs associated with resistance-conferring mutations, and allows for subsequent restoration of fitness because of compensatory mutations. Despite uncertainty in several key parameters, we demonstrate epidemic behavior that is robust over a range of assumptions. Whereas HIV facilitates the emergence of MDRTB within a community over several decades, HIV-seropositive individuals presenting with TB may, counterintuitively, be at lower risk of drug-resistant TB at early stages of the co-epidemic. This situation arises because many individuals with incident HIV infection will already harbor latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection acquired at an earlier time when drug resistance was less prevalent. We find that the rise of HIV can increase the prevalence of MDRTB within populations even as it lowers the average fitness of circulating MDRTB strains compared to similar populations unaffected by HIV. Preferential social mixing among individuals with similar HIV status and lower average CD4 counts among HIV-seropositive individuals further increase the expected burden of MDRTB. This model suggests that the individual-level association between HIV and drug-resistant forms of TB is dynamic, and therefore, cross-sectional studies that do not report a positive individual-level association will not provide assurance that HIV does not exacerbate the burden of resistant TB in the community.",4,1946-6242 (Electronic),135ra67,http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/4/135/135ra67,Science Translational Medicine
JOUR,article,990,Towards eliminating bias in cluster analysis of TB genotyped data,2012-01-01,"The relative contributions of transmission and reactivation of latent infection to TB cases observed clinically has been reported in many situations, but always with some uncertainty. Genotyped data from TB organisms obtained from patients have been used as the basis for heuristic distinctions between circulating (clustered strains) and reactivated infections (unclustered strains). Naive methods previously applied to the analysis of such data are known to provide biased estimates of the proportion of unclustered cases. The hypergeometric distribution, which generates probabilities of observing clusters of a given size as realized clusters of all possible sizes, is analyzed in this paper to yield a formal estimator for genotype cluster sizes. Subtle aspects of numerical stability, bias, and variance are explored. This formal estimator is seen to be stable with respect to the epidemiologically interesting properties of the cluster size distribution (the number of clusters and the number of singletons) though it does not yield satisfactory estimates of the number of clusters of larger sizes. The problem that even complete coverage of genotyping, in a practical sampling frame, will only provide a partial view of the actual transmission network remains to be explored.",7,1932-6203 (Electronic),e34109,http://www.plosone.org/article/fetchObjectAttachment.action?uri=info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0034109&representation=PDF,PLoS One

In certain instances transition rates (from one state to another) depend on the time spent in the state; therefore the states W, Y and Z depend on time and length of stay in that state - similar to age-structured models. The model is particularly amenable to describe delays of exposed persons to become infectious and re-infection of exposed persons. Other transitions that depend on state time include the case finding and diagnosis, increased death rate and treatment interruption.

JOUR,article,1312,Screening and rapid molecular diagnosis of tuberculosis in prisons in Russia and Eastern Europe: a cost-effectiveness analysis,2012-01-01,"BACKGROUND: Prisons of the former Soviet Union (FSU) have high rates of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and are thought to drive general population tuberculosis (TB) epidemics. Effective prison case detection, though employing more expensive technologies, may reduce long-term treatment costs and slow MDR-TB transmission. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We developed a dynamic transmission model of TB and drug resistance matched to the epidemiology and costs in FSU prisons. We evaluated eight strategies for TB screening and diagnosis involving, alone or in combination, self-referral, symptom screening, mass miniature radiography (MMR), and sputum PCR with probes for rifampin resistance (Xpert MTB/RIF). Over a 10-y horizon, we projected costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and TB and MDR-TB prevalence. Using sputum PCR as an annual primary screening tool among the general prison population most effectively reduced overall TB prevalence (from 2.78% to 2.31%) and MDR-TB prevalence (from 0.74% to 0.63%), and cost US$543/QALY for additional QALYs gained compared to MMR screening with sputum PCR reserved for rapid detection of MDR-TB. Adding sputum PCR to the currently used strategy of annual MMR screening was cost-saving over 10 y compared to MMR screening alone, but produced only a modest reduction in MDR-TB prevalence (from 0.74% to 0.69%) and had minimal effect on overall TB prevalence (from 2.78% to 2.74%). Strategies based on symptom screening alone were less effective and more expensive than MMR-based strategies. Study limitations included scarce primary TB time-series data in FSU prisons and uncertainties regarding screening test characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: In prisons of the FSU, annual screening of the general inmate population with sputum PCR most effectively reduces TB and MDR-TB prevalence, doing so cost-effectively. If this approach is not feasible, the current strategy of annual MMR is both more effective and less expensive than strategies using self-referral or symptom screening alone, and the addition of sputum PCR for rapid MDR-TB detection may be cost-saving over time.",9,1549-1676 (Electronic),e1001348,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3507963/pdf/pmed.1001348.pdf,PLoS Med
JOUR,article,1280,Application of a stochastic modeling to assess the evolution of tuberculous and non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection in patients treated with tumor necrosis factor inhibitors,2013-01-01,"In this manuscript we apply stochastic modeling to investigate the risk of reactivation of latent mycobacterial infections in patients undergoing treatment with tumor necrosis factor inhibitors. First, we review the perspective proposed by one of the authors in a previous work and which consists in predicting the occurrence of reactivation of latent tuberculosis infection or newly acquired tuberculosis during treatment; this is based on variational procedures on a simple set of parameters (e.g. rate of reactivation of a latent infection). Then, we develop a full analytical study of this approach through a Markov chain analysis and we find an exact solution for the temporal evolution of the number of cases of tuberculosis infection (re)activation. The analytical solution is compared with Monte Carlo simulations and with experimental data, showing overall excellent agreement. The generality of this theoretical framework allows to investigate also the case of non-tuberculous mycobacteria infections; in particular, we show that reactivation in that context plays a minor role. This may suggest that, while the screening for tuberculous is necessary prior to initiating biologics, when considering non-tuberculous mycobacteria only a watchful monitoring during the treatment is recommended. The framework outlined in this paper is quite general and could be extremely promising in further researches on drug-related adverse events.",8,1932-6203 (Electronic),e55017,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3557254/pdf/pone.0055017.pdf,PLoS One
JOUR,article,1278,Modeling the role of public transportation in sustaining tuberculosis transmission in South Africa,2013-01-01,"Current tuberculosis notification rates in South Africa are among the highest ever recorded. Although the human immunodeficiency virus epidemic has been a critical factor, the density of respiratory contacts in high-risk environments may be an important and underappreciated driver. Using a modified Wells-Riley model for airborne disease transmission, we estimated the risk of tuberculosis transmission on 3 modes of public transit (minibus taxis, buses, and trains) in Cape Town, South Africa, using exhaled carbon dioxide as a natural tracer gas to evaluate air exchange. Carbon dioxide measurements were performed between October and December of 2011. Environmental risk, reflected in the rebreathed fraction of air, was highest in minibus taxis and lowest in trains; however, the average number of passengers sharing an indoor space was highest in trains and lowest in minibus taxis. Among daily commuters, the annual risk of tuberculosis infection was projected to be 3.5%-5.0% and was highest among minibus taxi commuters. Assuming a duration of infectiousness of 1 year, the basic reproductive number attributable to transportation was more than 1 in all 3 modes of transportation. Given its poor ventilation and high respiratory contact rates, public transportation may play a critical role in sustaining tuberculosis transmission in South African cities.",177,1476-6256 (Electronic),556-61,http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/177/6/556.full.pdf,Am J Epidemiol
JOUR,article,1317,A time-to-event pharmacodynamic model describing treatment response in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis using days to positivity in automated liquid mycobacterial culture,2013-01-01,"Days to positivity in automated liquid mycobacterial culture have been shown to correlate with mycobacterial load and have been proposed as a useful biomarker for treatment responses in tuberculosis. However, there is currently no quantitative method or model to analyze the change in days to positivity with time on treatment. The objectives of this study were to describe the decline in numbers of mycobacteria in sputum collected once weekly for 8 weeks from patients on treatment for tuberculosis using days to positivity in liquid culture. One hundred forty-four patients with smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis were recruited from a tuberculosis clinic in Cape Town, South Africa. A nonlinear mixed-effects repeated-time-to-event modeling approach was used to analyze the time-to-positivity data. A biexponential model described the decline in the estimated number of bacteria in patients' sputum samples, while a logistic model with a lag time described the growth of the bacteria in liquid culture. At baseline, the estimated number of rapidly killed bacteria is typically 41 times higher than that of those that are killed slowly. The time to kill half of the rapidly killed bacteria was about 1.8 days, while it was 39 days for slowly killed bacteria. Patients with lung cavitation had higher bacterial loads than patients without lung cavitation. The model successfully described the increase in days to positivity as treatment progressed, differentiating between bacteria that are killed rapidly and those that are killed slowly. Our model can be used to analyze similar data from studies testing new drug regimens.",57,1098-6596 (Electronic),789-95,http://aac.asm.org/content/57/2/789.full.pdf,Antimicrob Agents Chemother
JOUR,article,1303,Is passive diagnosis enough?: the impact of subclinical disease on diagnostic strategies for tuberculosis,2013-01-01,"Rationale: Tuberculosis (TB) is characterized by a subclinical phase (symptoms absent or not considered abnormal); prediagnostic phase (symptoms noticed but diagnosis not pursued); and clinical phase (care actively sought). Diagnostic capacity during these phases is limited. Objectives: To estimate the population-level impact of TB case-finding strategies in the presence of subclinical and prediagnostic disease. Methods: We created a mathematical epidemic model of TB, calibrated to global incidence. We then introduced three prototypical diagnostic interventions: increased sensitivity of diagnosis in the clinical phase by 20% (""passive""); early diagnosis during the prediagnostic phase at a rate of 10% per year (""enhanced""); and population-based diagnosis of 5% of undiagnosed prevalent cases per year (""active""). Measurements and Main Results: If the subclinical phase was ignored, as in most models, the passive strategy was projected to reduce TB incidence by 18% (90% uncertainty range [UR], 11-32%) by year 10, compared with 23% (90% UR, 14-35%) for the enhanced strategy and 18% (90% UR, 11-28%) for the active strategy. After incorporating a subclinical phase into the model, consistent with population-based prevalence surveys, the active strategy still reduced 10-year TB incidence by 16% (90% UR, 11-28%), but the passive and enhanced strategies' impact was attenuated to 11% (90% UR, 8-25%) and 6% (90% UR, 4-13%), respectively. The degree of attenuation depended strongly on the transmission rate during the subclinical phase. Conclusions: Subclinical disease may limit the impact of current diagnostic strategies for TB. Active detection of undiagnosed prevalent cases may achieve greater population-level TB control than increasing passive case detection.",187,1535-4970 (Electronic),543-51,http://ajrccm.atsjournals.org/content/187/5/543.full.pdf,Am J Respir Crit Care Med
JOUR,article,1306,The epidemiological consequences of leprosy-tuberculosis co-infection,2013-01-01,"While in antiquity both leprosy and tuberculosis were prevalent in Europe, leprosy declined thereafter and, simultaneously, tuberculosis prevalence increased. Since both diseases are caused by mycobacterial infections, it has been suggested that there might be a causal relationship between both epidemics. Chaussinand observed the inverse prevalence of leprosy and tuberculosis and suggested that individuals with a latent tuberculosis infection are protected from acquiring leprosy. His cross-immunity hypothesis has been countered more recently by a co-infection hypothesis. The latter suggestion, proposed by Donoghue, states that people being infected with multi-bacillary leprosy are more susceptible to tuberculosis, which leads to increased mortality from the disease. This study utilizes mathematical modeling to explore the epidemiological consequences of the co-infection hypothesis for realistically confined parameter values. While the co-infection hypothesis appears plausible at first glance, a second thought reveals that it comprises also substantial consequences for tuberculosis epidemics: if co-infection raises the mortality rate above that of purely tuberculosis infected persons, then tuberculosis might as well be eradicated by leprosy. It is the specific interplay of both increased susceptibility towards tuberculosis and increased death rate when co-infected that determines the epidemiological fate. As a result of this analysis, it is shown that there is a large parameter region where the eventual disappearance of leprosy could indeed be explained by co-infection. This parameter region is considerably larger than that predicted by the cross-immunity hypothesis. This shows that the co-infection hypothesis should be considered a significant alternative to the cross-immunity hypothesis. The time scales at which the effects of co-infection are observed depend critically on the spatial distribution of the individuals but reach epidemiologically realistic values for rather immobile individuals with local interaction.",241,1879-3134 (Electronic),225-37,http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0025556412002283/1-s2.0-S0025556412002283-main.pdf?_tid=44cc1060-8c09-11e2-9bdf-00000aacb361&acdnat=1363198401_814dcb05fcde6861376376ea3cb88903,Math Biosci
JOUR,article,1284,A Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Model of Rifampin in Mice,2013-01-01,"One problem associated with regimen-based development of anti-tuberculosis (anti-TB) drugs is the difficulty of a systematic and thorough in vivo evaluation of the large number of possible regimens that arise from consideration of multiple drugs tested together. A mathematical model capable of simulating the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of experimental combination chemotherapy of TB offers a way to mitigate this problem by extending the use of available data to investigate regimens that are not initially tested. In order to increase the available mathematical tools needed to support such a model for preclinical anti-TB drug development, we constructed a preliminary whole-body physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model of rifampin in mice, using data from the literature. Interindividual variability was approximated using Monte Carlo (MC) simulation with assigned probability distributions for the model parameters. An MC sensitivity analysis was also performed to determine correlations between model parameters and plasma concentration to inform future model development. Model predictions for rifampin concentrations in plasma, liver, kidneys, and lungs, following oral administration, were generally in agreement with published experimental data from multiple studies. Sensitive model parameters included those descriptive of oral absorption, total clearance, and partitioning of rifampin between blood and muscle. This PBPK model can serve as a starting point for the integration of rifampin pharmacokinetics in mice into a larger mathematical framework, including the immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, and pharmacokinetic models for other anti-TB drugs.",NA,1098-6596 (Electronic),NA,http://aac.asm.org/content/early/2013/01/22/AAC.01567-12.full.pdf,Antimicrob Agents Chemother
JOUR,article,1321,Understanding TB latency using computational and dynamic modelling procedures,2013-01-01,"The Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli's potency to cause persistent latent infection that is unresponsive to the current cocktail of TB drugs is strongly associated with its ability to adapt to changing intracellular environments, and tolerating, evading and subverting host defence mechanisms. We applied a combination of bioinformatics and mathematical modelling methods to enhance the understanding of TB latency dynamics. Analysis of time course microarray gene expression data was carried out and gene profiles for bacilli adaptation and survival in latency, simulated by hypoxia were determined. Reverse network engineering techniques were used to predict gene dependencies and regulatory interactions. Biochemical systems theory was applied to mathematically model the inferred gene regulatory networks. Significant regulatory genes involved in latency were determined by a combination of systems biology procedures and mathematical modelling of the inferred regulatory networks. Analysis of gene clusters of the inferred networks in the stationary and non-replicating phases of the bacilli predicted probable functions of some of the latency genes to be associated with latency genes of known functions. The systems biology approach and mathematical computational deletion experiments predicted key genes in the TB latency/dormancy program that may be possible TB drug targets.

JOUR,article,1281,Diagnosing Xpert MTB/RIF negative TB: impact and cost of alternative algorithms for South Africa,2013-01-01,"BACKGROUND: Use of Xpert MTB/RIF is being scaled up throughout South Africa for improved diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB). A large proportion of HIV-infected patients with possible TB are Xpert-negative on their initial test, and the existing diagnostic algorithm calls for these patients to have sputum culture (Xpert followed by culture (X/C)). We modelled the costs and impact of an alternative diagnostic algorithm in which these cultures are replaced with a second Xpert test (Xpert followed by Xpert (X/X)). METHODS: An existing population-level decision model was used. Costs were estimated from Xpert implementation studies and public sector price and salary data. The number of patients requiring diagnosis was estimated from the literature, as were rates of TB treatment uptake and loss to follow-up. TB and HIV positivity rates were estimated from the national TB register and laboratory databases. RESULTS: At national programme scale in 2014, X/X (R969 million/year) is less expensive than X/C R1 095 million/year), potentially saving R126 million/year (US$17.4 million). However, because Xpert is less sensitive than culture, X/X diagnoses 2% fewer TB cases. This is partly offset by higher expected treatment uptake with X/X due to the faster availability of results, resulting in 1% more patients initiating treatment under X/X than X/C. The cost per TB patient initiated on treatment under X/X is R2 682, which is 12% less than under X/C (R3 046). CONCLUSIONS: Modifying the diagnostic algorithm from X/C to X/X could provide rapid results, simplify diagnostic processes, improve HIV/TB treatment outcomes, and generate cost savings.",103,0256-9574 (Print),101-6,http://www.samj.org.za/index.php/samj/article/view/6182,S Afr Med J
JOUR,article,1422,Cost utility of lateral-flow urine lipoarabinomannan for tuberculosis diagnosis in HIV-infected African adults,2013-01-01,"SETTING: In-patient hospitals in South Africa and Uganda. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a lateral-flow urine lipoarabinomannan (LAM) test when added to existing strategies for tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis in human immunodeficiency virus infected adults (CD4(+) T-cell counts < 100 cells/l) with symptoms of active TB. DESIGN: Decision-analytic cost-utility model, with the primary outcome being the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, expressed in 2010 US dollars per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted from the perspective of a public sector TB control program. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: For every 1000 patients tested, adding lateral-flow urine LAM generated 80 incremental appropriate anti-tuberculosis treatments and averted 224 DALYs. Estimated cost utility was US$353 per DALY averted (95% uncertainty range $192$1161) in South Africa and $86 per DALY averted (95% uncertainty range $49$239) in Uganda, reflecting the lower treatment costs in Uganda. Cost utility was most sensitive to assay specificity, cost of anti-tuberculosis treatment, life expectancy after TB cure and cohort TB prevalence, but did not rise above $1500 per DALY averted in South Africa under any one-way sensitivity analysis. The probability of acceptability was >99.8% at a per-DALY willingness-to-pay threshold equal to the per capita gross domestic product in South Africa ($7275) and Uganda ($509).",17,1815-7920 (Electronic),552-8,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23485389,International Journal of Tuberculosis and Lung Disease
